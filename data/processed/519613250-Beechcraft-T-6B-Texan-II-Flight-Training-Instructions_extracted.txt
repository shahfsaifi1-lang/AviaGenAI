INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT    1-1 
CHAPTER ONE 
INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT 
 
100. INTRODUCTION 
 
This Flight Training Instruction (FTI) is a Naval Air Training Command directive published by 
Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).  The information and instructions are relative to all 
instructors and Student Naval Aviators (SNA) operating T-6B aircraft in the Primary Phase of 
training in the Naval Air Training Command.  It is very important that the factual material 
contained herein be thoroughly studied and retained. 
 
The process by which a student is transformed into a skilled naval aviator is both complex and 
demanding.  It can be accomplished only by intensive instruction in the air as well as in the 
classroom.  Success, for the most part, depends upon the student’s attitude, cooperation, and 
attention to detail.  The degree of skill attained by students depends largely upon their ability to 
understand new material and to work hard.  Those students who cannot measure up to the high 
standards required throughout the various phases of training, because of either their lack of 
motivation or ability, must and will be attrited.  
 
This FTI does not contain all the information necessary for a student pilot to become a 
professional aviator.  Rather, this instruction provides a focal point and reference manual for all 
other sources of technical information, outlining and amplifying the flight procedures where 
necessary.  This manual is designed as a training tool and is not meant to establish policy 
concerning fleet operations.  Every effort has been made to remain in accordance with current 
fleet procedures.  It is important to note that the emergency procedures shown are to aid in the 
topic discussion.  For all emergencies, the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual is the final authority.  
Through this cross-referencing and organization of information, the student pilot should be able 
to develop a thorough understanding of the manual and flight procedures that form the backbone 
of an aviation career.  
 
Congratulations on your commencement of primary flight training.  Your hard work and 
determination has earned you the unique opportunity to become part of the most elite team of 
aviation warriors in the world today.  The United States Naval Aviator is a highly trained 
professional.  The tremendous level of skill demanded by the naval air community can only be 
obtained through total dedication and sustained maximum effort.  It is imperative that every 
Student Naval Aviator  apply himself or herself completely.  Anything less than your best effort 
is unacceptable.  Best of luck in your endeavor to earn your "Wings of Gold."  
 
101. HISTORY OF CONTACT TRAINING 
 
Naval aviation training has come a long way since 1910 when Lieutenant T. G. Ellyson was 
ordered to flight instruction to become the first Naval Aviator.  Soon thereafter, the U.S. Navy 
purchased its first airplane, the Curtis Triad, at a cost of $5,500.  Since that time, naval aviation 
technology has progressed at a rapid rate.  The fleet aircraft of today’s Navy are tremendously 
complex and demanding machines, capable of astonishing performance.  Advancements in 
aviation technology are only part of a much bigger picture.  Even the most modern aircraft will 

--- PAGE 14 ---
CHAPTER ONE  PRIMARY CONTACT 
1-2    INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT 
fail to accomplish its mission if piloted by a poorly trained or incompetent aviator.  Therefore, a 
thorough and comprehensive training program is essential for mission accomplishment.  
 
Early aviation pioneers suffered through many "accidents," which became unwanted yet 
commonplace occurrences.  A "good" landing was any one that you could walk away from!  
Today, the safety record of naval aviation is the best it has ever been.  Accidents or "mishaps" 
are rare, yet do occur.  Anything greater than a zero mishap rate is undesirable.  Mishap-free 
operation is the ultimate goal, and SAFETY is a primary concern during all aspects of training.  
There is NO acceptable loss and NO toleration for anything less than total professionalism.  This 
is a goal we can achieve.  Your instructors will set an example that you should strive to mirror.  
 
102. SCOPE OF INSTRUCTION 
 
So far as is practical, all information and instructions governing T-6B aircraft procedures and the 
execution of curriculum maneuvers will be published for inclusion in this manual.  Procedures 
peculiar to Whiting Field (TW-5) and Corpus Christi (TW-4) may be found in the TW-5 Fixed 
Wing Operating Procedures (FWOP) Manual or TW-4 Standardization Notes/NAS Corpus 
Christi Course Rules. 
 
Terms that would be included ordinarily in a glossary for T-6B Contact training are defined as 
they are used throughout the text.  
 
1. Learning Objectives.  The course objective is broken down into Stage (Terminal) 
Learning Objectives.  Terminals are further broken down into Enabling Learning Objectives. 
These are designed to be smaller, bite-size chunks of the overall objective.  The Terminal 
Objectives are listed in the CNATRA governing instruction.  
 
2. Enabling Objectives, Maneuvers And Exercises.  Each event in this stage is comprised 
of various tasks the student will have to perform.  This could be performing a spin on a contact 
flight, or reciting an emergency procedure during a lecture, or answering a test question correctly 
in an end-of-course exam.  The Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) Curriculum, Flight Training 
Instruction, and Academic Training Instruction break down each of these tasks in detail. 
 
The maneuvers or other items that you will perform on the events may be graded or nongraded.  
This means that this particular item may or may not be used to compare you to course training 
standards.  This does not mean that the instructor may not evaluate a nongraded item.  The 
student is just as responsible, for example, for a demo (nongraded) item as for a graded  item.  If 
the instructor determines a blatant lack of preparation for either, an unsatisfactory grade is

INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT    1-3 
CNATRAINST 1542.166.  This pocket guide is the curriculum outline.  It describes what each 
Student Naval Aviator (SNA) will do in the Primary phase of training.  The maneuvers and 
exercises in the syllabus are described, as well as the standards of performance to be achieved.  
Each event lists all of the maneuvers to be performed.  When there is no task listing in the 
description of an event, then another publication describes the conduct of that event.  For 
example, although the Joint Primary Pilot Training System (JPPT) Curriculum simply lists 
Aerodynamics as the event, the Aerodynamics Academic Training Instruction (ATI) lists the 
material to be covered. 
 
2. FLIGHT AND ACADEMIC TRAINING INSTRUCTIONS.  These are called "peculiar 
to aviation training" (PAT) pubs and are produced by CNATRA specifically for each of its 
curricula.  These PAT pubs describe the various maneuvers and exercises the SNA will be 
required to perform, and list any additional pubs or study material that the student may need to 
reference for an event.  The SNA is responsible for all material listed in these training 
instructions.  Each stage of training has an associated FTI containing the information necessary 
for a student to complete the curriculum satisfactorily.  It is every pilot’s responsibility to be 
thoroughly familiar with the contents of this manual.  Strict adherence to the manner of 
execution of maneuvers, patterns, procedures and instructions herein promulgated is mandatory 
for all instructors and Student Naval Aviator s operating the T-6B aircraft. 
 
3. 1500.4 (TA MANUAL) AND THE AVIATION TRAINING JACKET.  CNATRAINST 
1500.4 is commonly referred to as the Training Administration (TA) manual.  The TA manual is 
Student Control’s guide to handling its students.  Normally, those areas of the TA manual for 
which the SNA is responsible will be outlined to the student upon check in.  Such student 
responsibilities always include obtaining jacket reviews, ensuring Aviation Training Forms 
(ATF) make their way to the Aviation Training Jacket (ATJ), and updating the calendar card.  
These responsibilities should not be taken lightly.  The responsibility (or lack thereof) that a 
student displays with these administrative details can be a direct indication of how seriously a 
student is applying himself/ herself to an aviation training program.  
 
4. AVIATION TRAINING FORMS.  These are records of the training events that take 
place for a student.  They also record the instructor’s evaluation of student performance.  These 
are permanent, official documents that remain in the SNA’s jacket forever.  They are never 
removed or altered by anyone except under very special circumstances listed in the TA manual.  
Any student who alters or removes an ATF from his or her jacket will be subject to attrition 
under the provisions of the TA manual.  
 
5. NATOPS PROGRAM.  Every Student Naval Aviator  becomes familiar with Naval Air 
Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) early in his or her career.  You 
will be issued a T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual before you start ground school, and a General 
NATOPS (OPNAVINST 3710.7) should be available to you.  The NATOPS program is the 
responsibility of all who use it.  NATOPS only works if everyone is involved.  Even as a Student 
Naval Aviator, it is your responsibility to originate changes if you find errors or ambiguities in 
the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual.  See the squadron NATOPS officer regarding the correct 
procedure to submit a change recommendation to the NATOPS Flight Manual.

CHAPTER ONE  PRIMARY CONTACT 
1-4    INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT 
6. T-6B NATOPS FLIGHT MANUAL AND POCKET CHECKLIST.  The T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual is the definitive instruction on the operation of the aircraft.  The Pocket 
Checklist (PCL) is a convenient pocket sized listing of those items in the T-6B NATOPS Flight 
Manual that would be of particular concern while airborne or at a remote location.  No student or 
flight instructor has the authority to deviate from the Flight Manual without specific written 
authority except in specific situations.  The T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual also lists the crew 
requirements for flying the aircraft.  There is a bank of questions in the back of the T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual that every aviator should be familiar with.  Both the T-6B NATOPS 
Flight Manual and the PCL list emergency procedures.  Some of these procedures are listed in 
Boldface or with asterisks next to them.  These items are memory items, and the SNA shall be 
able to recall and apply any of these procedures correctly to the appropriate aircraft malfunction.  
In addition to the emergency procedures, a pilot should be able to recall the Landing Checklist 
from memory.  Other than these, every checklist should be performed with the aid of the PCL or 
appropriate guide.  Familiarity with the PCL should be acquired in an attempt to ensure efficient 
use under potentially arduous situations while airborne.  
 
In Primary Training, there is no room for libraries of publications.  T-6B aircrews must be 
thoroughly familiar with their aircraft.  They must study the Flight manual in-depth and have a 
thorough knowledge of it because no opportunity exists to do so while airborne.  The T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual requires the use of checklists.  Although a student may become familiar 
with a checklist, pocket checklists are to be used to ensure no items are missed.  
 
104. ACADEMIC/FLIGHT SUPPORT TRAINING 
 
The terminal objective of flight support training and academics is to provide the SNA with the 
basic knowledge and skills directly applicable to satisfactory progression in the T-6B aircraft 
flight training.  Upon completion of the academic and flight support activities, the student will be 
capable of relating these acquired cognitive skills and applying them through simulation and 
actual flights, thus developing the motor skills and headwork necessary to meet CNATRA 
standards to complete primary flight training.  
 
105. STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE 
 
1. STANDARDIZATION.  Flight instruction must be highly standardized.  The syllabi that 
are currently being used are the result of constant evolution and the procedures taught are lessons 
learned over the course of many years.  The FTI and T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual set forth the 
one standardized way of doing any specific maneuver.  Adherence to these standards will be a 
part of any instructor’s evaluation of a student’s performance during an event.  Occasionally, a 
student may question a particular instructor’s technique, or he may think that an instructor is 
incorrect.  There is no time for protracted discussion or debate in the air.  If an instructor’s 
request is unclear to the student, he must request clarification.  If, however, the student feels that 
the instructor’s methods contradict the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual or the FTI, he should 
consult his class advisor on the appropriate way to address the issue.  In any event, when the 
student feels that flight safety is in jeopardy, he is bound to request a Training Time Out to 
obtain clarification.  Training Time Out is defined in section 108 of this publication. 
 

--- PAGE 17 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER ONE 
 
INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT    1-5 
The standard flight procedures employed in the training syllabus are universal to all Navy 
aircraft, except when slight deviations have been adapted in the interest of flight safety.  
 
Maximum utilization of instructor/aircraft time demands a thorough knowledge of the flight 
training instructions and referenced publications by both the flight student and instructor.  The 
time designated for the pre-flight briefing is equally limited and demands that both student and 
instructor have a complete knowledge of the material to be covered in preparation for the flight. 
Briefing time should be applied to review of previous difficulties, clarification of 
misunderstandings, and immediate flight planning.  It is essential that the instructor and the 
student have a common understanding of the maneuvers to be flown and employ the same 
nomenclature in order to take full advantage of the time afforded.  
 
2. GRADES.  The adage is that if you worry about learning, the grades take care of 
themselves.  The truth is that one should be trying to perform to the best of his or her ability at all 
times.  Grades are designed to do two things: compare performance to a set standard or criterion; 
and contrast performance of individuals within the same curriculum.  
 
There is little to be gained by sweating over grades.  There is much to learn by focusing on the 
learning objectives for a course.  The nature of flight training is such that if one misses a step, it 
is very difficult to catch up.  The syllabus is designed to give the average student sufficient time 
and opportunity to complete the objectives.  When it becomes apparent to an instructor that 
objectives are not being met, or the student is having difficulty, the student’s grades will reflect 
this.  The student should not take grades as a personal affront.  The instructor should make every 
effort not only to critique the student, but also to give the student the information required to 
perform the exercise or maneuver in an acceptable manner.  The best instructors are not those 
who give the best grades, but those who best prepare the students for their next flight.  Students 
should simply concentrate on correctly performing the maneuvers of the next hop, and meeting 
the stage and phase objectives.  Students who are able to do this are successful in the Naval Air 
Training Command. 
 
3. CHECK FLIGHTS.  The student should place no special significance on designated 
check flights and should not anticipate failure if a superlative performance is not demonstrated.  
The designated check flight is merely a validation by another instructor of the evaluations other 
instructors have given the student.  If a student fails to meet the accepted standards of progress, 
the instructor will grade the student’s performance unsatisfactory rather than allow him to 
continue ahead in the syllabus.  The check pilot is obligated to judge the student fairly in 
comparison with accepted standards. 
 
106. THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR 
 
The flight instructor is an experienced aviator, trained to provide the student with a sound 
foundation in the operation of the aircraft.  He has undergone a training course similar to the 
student’s, which familiarizes him with the curriculum maneuvers and teaches an effective means 
of presenting them.  This training comes under the heading of standardization.  The intent of 
standardization is to provide the instructor with a logical, effective, and consistent foundation 
upon which to present any maneuver.  This in turn ensures that all students can be judged on the 

--- PAGE 18 ---
CHAPTER ONE  PRIMARY CONTACT 
1-6    INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT 
same basis, each having been exposed to the same material and afforded an equal opportunity to 
demonstrate his/her abilities.  No two instructors will be identical in their techniques and each 
may vary his/her presentation to fit the needs of the individual student.  
 
In order to teach you to fly the T-6B properly, the instructor must criticize!  His/her comments 
on your performance of the various maneuvers are intended to improve your understanding.  All 
criticism by the instructor is meant to be constructive in character.  The instructor’s sole intent is 
to instill confidence and develop you into a qualified naval aviator.  
 
Your flight instructor is a vital part of your training.  Nonetheless, you must do your part as well. 
The one word that you will hear most from your instructor is "PROCEDURES!"  In order that 
your time in the aircraft can be devoted to the improvement of maneuver performance, it is 
imperative that you learn, memorize, and understand the procedural steps required in performing 
each of the various maneuvers.  Then and only then can your instructor’s time with you be 
profitably utilized.  The instructor is well trained and qualified to teach his/her student, but 
his/her success requires the fullest cooperation of the student himself/herself.  If you have 
questions about procedures or concepts, ask them.  Again, knowing procedures, both for normal 
and emergency operations, cannot be overemphasized!  They must be over-learned so that they 
can be recalled in flight, especially during periods of high cockpit workload and stressful 
situations. 
 
CONTRACT INSTRUCTORS.  Simulator instructors are generally civilians, contracted to the 
Navy to provide simulator flight instruction, and teach academics.  These instructors are all 
experienced military aviators.  They are bound by the same instruction as their military 
counterparts.  The simulator event should be treated just as a flight event.  Both events require 
the same dedicated preparation and forethought.  The contract instructor (CI) is also responsible 
for standardization.  If you notice a nonstandard maneuver or technique, bring it to the attention 
of the standardization officer at the squadron.  
 
107. THE STUDENT NAVAL AVIATOR 
 
The qualifications to become a SNA are high.  The SNA has been selected for flight training by a 
screening process that determines his/her superiority over the average American youth with 
respect to physical condition, intelligence, ability to grasp and retain new ideas, and apparent 
emotional stability.  Superior reasoning ability will enable him/ her to combine these talents into 
experience that will produce a qualified naval aviator.  One critical factor of success, which 
cannot be accurately evaluated by the normal selection process, is mental attitude.  Mental 
attitude, as much as any other factor, determines the ease or difficulty with which the student 
progresses through the training syllabus.  Under the heading of positive mental attitude come 
such elements as willingness to conform to military discipline, acceptance of curtailed personal 
freedom and leisure, and the ability to encounter occasional reverses and still maintain 
enthusiasm and self-confidence.  
 
Motivation and mental attitude are closely related.  The student’s motivation greatly affects his 
or her mental attitude and consequently his or her progress throughout training.  The majority of 
students have had little or no previous aviation experience.  Flight training is arduous and places 

--- PAGE 19 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER ONE 
 
INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT    1-7 
great demands on the student’s time and energy.  Therefore, motivation plays an important part 
in difficult periods.  The student who discovers that he or she does not enjoy flying but remains 
because of prestige or monetary compensation will find that his or her chances of successfully 
completing the program are poor.  The desire to earn those coveted wings of gold and the love of 
flying provide the highest motivation and the greatest likelihood of success.  
 
With these basic qualities as a foundation, the experience you gain as you progress through each 
stage of your training will develop the many facets of your skill and judgment.  This will allow 
you to cope with the many and varied problems that may confront you in the handling of your 
aircraft under all conditions.  Although your instructor and other personnel are at your disposal to 
help solve various problems, your own intelligent analysis, based on acquired knowledge, will 
generally permit you to arrive at correct and logical conclusions.  
 
Flying is a highly physical attribute and, like many other acts of a physical nature, is mostly a 
matter of coordination of hands, feet and eyes.  As far as controlling the attitude and performance 
of the aircraft is concerned, the elementary methods of flying are not at all difficult to master.  
But, because it is performed in an environment to which you will not be accustomed, you may 
experience some difficulty adapting to the airborne classroom.  With your instructor’s patience 
and your own hard work and alertness, the readjustment required will occur naturally and you 
will find that the T-6B is one of the most enjoyable classrooms in the world.  Every student 
should remember these guidelines when managing his/her training program.  
 
1. Your flight instructor wants  you to learn to be a professional aviator.  If in doubt, ask 
questions and use your flight instructor to help you through problem areas.  
 
2. Preparation is the key to professionalism.  Do not be satisfied with only knowing enough to 
complete the hop.  What is being taught in the primary phase has a direct transference to all 
future training. 
 
Remember one important thing for as long as you fly an aircraft:  You must be your own most 
aggressive critic.  This does not mean that you become a mental case in the cockpit, but it does 
mean that as an aviator beginning the flight training syllabus, you must demonstrate one of the 
most critical qualities a professional aviator has: self-discipline.  This means that you prepare for 
every hop as if your professional reputation is at stake.  Your flights are not contests where 
someone is keeping score and counting your mistakes.  Your flight grades should not be as 
important as your own honest appraisal of your flight performance.  You are expected to come 
well prepared, but you must expect to make mistakes.  Most of these mistakes are forgiven as 
long as you deal with them professionally, on the spot and learn from them.  That is why they 
call this flight training. 
 
108. TRAINING TIME OUT 
 
CNATRAINST 1500.4 (series), defines the conditions under which a Training Time Out (TTO) 
may be requested.  It states in part, "A TTO may be called in any training situation whenever a 
student or instructor expresses concern for personal safety or a need for clarification of 
procedures or requirements exists." 

--- PAGE 20 ---
CHAPTER ONE  PRIMARY CONTACT 
1-8    INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT 
The intent of TTO is to give students and instructors the means to stop a flight if they are not 
"communicating" or if either party feels they are in an unsafe position.  It will not be used to 
terminate a flight just because you are having a bad day or do not know your procedures.  
Nevertheless, do not be hesitant to use TTO if you feel the flight conditions warrant it.  
 
109. CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
 
The “Human Error” factor or inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM) is the single 
leading cause factor for Class A mishaps in modern naval aviation.  As defined in OPNAVINST 
3710.7, CRM describes the use of “specifically defined behavioral skills as an integral part of 
every flight to improve mission effectiveness by minimizing crew preventable errors, 
maximizing crew coordination, and optimizing risk management.”  It includes all crew members, 
equipment, and external factors involving the flight from before the flight brief to after the flight 
debrief. 
 
During primary, you will be provided with both ground and flight CRM training.  Since research 
and development began in 1991, the CRM program and its seven skills have become fully 
integrated into all aspects of naval aviation and are governed by OPNAVINST 1542.7 (series).  
With the instructor/student relationship required by the nature of primary flight training, it is 
imperative that both instructors and students actively practice good CRM to ensure that safety is 
maintained at all times.  This should not preclude the instructors from ensuring students are able 
to perform as single-pilots, but should provide guidance to maintain safety in the cockpit. 
 
1. Sandbag Syndrome.  The sandbag syndrome is based on a comforting premise that one or 
more other crew members have the situation under control and are looking out for your best 
interest.  It is a direct breakdown of CRM skills such as:  leadership, assertiveness, and 
situational awareness.  The sandbag syndrome is mainly experienced at certain times when the 
instructor pilot has assumed flying duties, such as breaks in training, approaches, enroute 
transits, etc.  This effectively results in the SNA being "along for the ride."  It is important to 
remember that no pilot is above the momentary lapse of judgment or situational awareness that 
could result in a flight violation or mishap.  Do not let this happen to you!  As a copilot, your 
primary responsibility is to support and back up the pilot at the controls.  
 
Stay alert and be assertive when necessary.  The instructor/student relationship often fosters 
reluctance on the part of the SNA to confront the Instructor Pilot (IP).  But remember, do not let 
misplaced professional courtesies stand in the way of maintaining safe and efficient flying 
practices.  
 
2. "I’m Safe" Checklist.  As a rule, good aircrew coordination begins with the individual 
crew member.  Our situational awareness resources might be lacking before we even set foot in 
the cockpit.  Unfortunately, we do not have external readouts telling ourselves when they are 
diminished.  Therefore, it is important that every pilot conduct a daily personal preflight prior to 
each flight.  "I’M SAFE" is a simple checklist to determine if we are ready and fit to fly.  Do not 
show up for a brief without first conducting a personal preflight.

110. PHYSICAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS 
 
To help you understand something of the physical and psychological factors affecting your 
training, the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to paraphrasing our flight surgeon’s 
thoughts on the matter. 
 
1. Physical ease and relaxation while flying makes the difference between the pilot flying the 
plane and the plane flying the pilot.  A proper sense of "feel" of the aircraft is essential.  Just as a 
good horseman must be sensitive to the movements of his mount, so must the aviator be sensitive 
to the movements of the airplane.  This innate sense cannot be achieved in any other way than by 
the proper relaxation of all the body muscles and light touch on the aircraft’s controls.  The art of 
being relaxed in an airplane involves an awareness of what your body and mind are doing.  A 
natural reaction to the strange environment or unusual situation is the age-old aviator tendency to 
"pucker" in a tight situation.  Be alert for involuntary tensing of the muscles and you will find 
you quickly develop that sought-after "feel" and avoid the hard-to-break habit of mechanical 
flying.  An important aspect of developing this sense of "feel" is knowing what you are going to 
do at all times and be prepared for the next evolution in your flight training.  This is nothing 
more than knowing your PROCEDURES.  Remember the panic in your school days when you 
were handed a test and it suddenly dawned on you that you had not studied, or what you had 
studied was not on the test?  
 
2. Mental attitude is a very essential element to your relaxation in an aircraft.  It affects your 
nervous system and, if allowed to continue in an unhealthy trend, can result in actual physical 
incapacitation.  Therefore, its significance should be fully appreciated.  As with physical 
handicaps, any mental distraction will also detract from the full use of your required senses.  A 
poor mental attitude will interfere with your ability to concentrate, learn, and apply your 
knowledge.  In turn, a good or positive mental attitude will increase your learning capacity and 
will make your flight training a pleasure rather than an unpleasant job. 
 
If for any reason you find yourself "flying more, and enjoying it less," whether from some 
known cause or not, discuss it with your flight instructor or unit leader.  Another aid to acquiring 
a positive mental attitude, after you have satisfied yourself that it is not an outside problem 
affecting you mentally, is to find some healthy diversion that will get your mind away from the 
subject of flying for a time.  The base as well as the local area offers much in the way of 
recreational opportunities and diversions.  
 
 

--- PAGE 22 ---
CHAPTER ONE  PRIMARY CONTACT 
1-10    INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT 
3. Mental alertness on the pilot’s part has a direct bearing upon safety of flight as well as 
contributing significantly to the learning process.  Remember that the training areas utilized are 
not very large and are used by many aircraft.  Being constantly on the alert while flying may 
save your life and that of one of your squadron mates.  Mental laziness is the constant enemy of 
every aviator.  So, as you progress through flight training, plan ahead and try to anticipate all 
possible contingencies that could affect the operation of your aircraft.  Proper planning not only 
refers to the environment around you but also the aircraft in which you are sitting.  Check your 
engine instruments from time to time to ensure that all is well up front.  In other words, train 
yourself to be alert to all facets of your flight rather than concentrating on the problem of the 
moment.  You will find yourself surprised at the amount of information your eyes will transmit 
to your brain during a quick SCAN of your surroundings.  Planning ahead will also equip you to 
take immediate and appropriate action should an emergency occur.  
 
4. Confidence in your aircraft, your instructor, and most importantly yourself, is another 
essential element of flying.  The basic ingredient to acquiring the confidence necessary to 
professionally pilot an aircraft is knowledge and efficient analytical application of that 
knowledge.  The aircraft you are flying has been engineered to provide you with every safety 
feature known to the industry.  The risks beyond the control of the pilot are minimal.  Fire is an 
extremely rare occurrence.  Engines are inherently reliable.  In-flight collisions are rarities that 
are completely avoidable if you stay alert.  With the above points in mind, it is readily apparent 
that the chance of an aviation accident caused by anything other than incompetence, 
disobedience or poor judgment is remote.  Remember that 70% of all fatal accidents are due to 
100% pilot error.  With all this going for you, do not let human frailty or overconfidence 
develop, particularly while your experience is limited.  The instant that a pilot begins to lose that 
feeling of respect due an aircraft, he has reached a stage when anything can happen and usually 
does.  Good pilots are never caught unprepared in an emergency situation.  They know and 
understand emergency procedures COLD!  Humble confidence and perseverance will go a long 
way in striving for those Wings of Gold.  
 
5. Occasionally physiological problems arise during the course of a flight.  Airsickness, 
fatigue, hypoxia, food poisoning and dehydration can overcome a pilot and result in reduced 
situational awareness and even complete incapacitation.  Pilots must not only recognize these 
symptoms in themselves but also in other crew members.  At any time, the non-affected crew 
member should be ready to take the controls, and if necessary, fly to a safer environment (i.e., 
higher altitude, away from other aircraft and clouds) to include termination of the flight.  
Airsickness is common during early Contact flights and, even though it is not usually 
incapacitating, it affects judgment and reduces situational awareness.  If this occurs, inform your 
instructor.  
 
111. FLIGHT SIMULATORS 
 
You won’t always have a formal training device at your disposal to prepare for your simulators 
and flights.  “Chair flying” or “hangar flying” is an excellent way to prepare at home, preferably 
with a classmate.  Strap your checklist on your knee, put on your gloves, grab a simulated control  
 
 

--- PAGE 23 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER ONE 
 
INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT    1-11 
stick and mentally accomplish each segment of your imaginary flight.  Visualize each procedural 
step of your planned maneuvers and verbalize your radio calls.  “Chair flying” is a skill in itself 
and can reap major rewards in all phases of your training and throughout your career. 
 
Simulators have proven to be valuable assets in helping students learn the physical attributes 
necessary to become a good pilot.  Before you climb into the T-6B aircraft for the first time, you 
will have practiced the use of checklists, basic flight and emergency procedures several times.  
There are 3 types of simulators available for your use: a static trainer, Unit Training Device 
(UTD), and Operational Flight Trainer (OFT).  In addition to the syllabus training that you 
receive in the UTD or OFT, you should utilize the static trainers at every opportunity.  Practice 
will pay off with better grades, self confidence and more professional performance. 
 
UTD/OFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR.  The UTD is a training device with no visual system 
designed to support procedural and instrument flight requiring no outside visual references.  The 
OFT is a training device with a wide field of view visual system to support instrument and visual 
flight training.  These simulators do not have full motion.  The instruments and flight controls 
behave exactly as those in the aircraft.  If there is a discrepancy in the device, it is the 
responsibility of the aircrew (you) to provide maintenance data.  Normally, this consists of 
telling the simulator instructor about the problem.  Do not be complacent about discrepancies on 
a flight simulator. 
 
112. THE AIRCRAFT 
 
The first aircraft you will fly in this program is the Hawker-Beechcraft T-6B “Texan II.”  It is a 
pressurized two-place, tandem cockpit, low wing, high-performance, single engine monoplane 
equipped with dual controls.  Power is provided by a turbo-prop engine manufactured by Pratt & 
Whitney Aircraft of Canada, Model PT6A-68, with inverted flight capabilities, providing a flight 
envelope with altitudes to 31,000 feet.  Reference your T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual for 
detailed aircraft information and operating procedures.

T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-1 
CHAPTER TWO 
T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS 
 
200. INTRODUCTION 
 
Prior to your first flight in the T-6B, there are several fundamental topics that you should review 
and understand if you are to obtain maximum benefit from your primary training.  These topics 
include not only basic aerodynamics, but also certain principles pertaining to safety of flight.  
While more complex theories were covered in the classroom during Aviation Indoctrination, the 
basics are considered to be of sufficient importance to repeat in broad terms at this time.  The 
discussions in this chapter provide Student Naval Aviators with the basic factors of flight before 
actually beginning to fly.  
 
In addition, this chapter discusses the controls with which you will operate the aircraft about the 
three axes of motion, and how to use them effectively. 
 
201. THEORIES OF FLIGHT 
 
1. Lift And Thrust.  Our discussion will include several basic laws of physics that help to 
explain how an airplane flies.  Sir Isaac Newton is credited with having observed in 1687,". . . 
for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction . . ." This principle applies whenever two 
objects act upon each other, such as the air and the propeller, or the air and the wing of the 
airplane.  In short, the statement about "action and reaction" tells us how lift and propulsion of 
airplanes are produced.  
 
The predominant method by which air exerts force on a solid body, such as an airplane’s wing, is 
through pressure.  For our purposes, friction can be ignored.  In the 1700’s, Daniel Bernoulli (a 
Swiss mathematician) discovered the Venturi Principle.  He found that if the velocity of a fluid 
(air) is increased at a particular point, the static pressure of the fluid (air) at that point is 
decreased.  The airplane’s wing is designed to increase the velocity of the air flowing over the 
top of the wing as it moves through the air.  To do this, the top of the wing is curved, while the 
bottom is relatively flat.  The air flowing over the top travels a little farther (since it is curving) 
than the air flowing along the flat bottom.  This means the air on top must go faster.  Hence, the 
static pressure decreases, resulting in a lower static pressure (as Bernoulli stated) on top of the 
wing and a relatively higher static pressure below.  The pressure differential then pushes the 
wing up towards the lower pressure area, i.e., LIFT.  To increase the lift, the wing is tilted 
upward in relation to the oncoming air (relative wind) to increase the deflection of air.  Relative 
wind during flight is the direction of the airflow in relation to the wing as it moves through the 
air.  The angle at which the wing meets the relative wind is called the angle of attack.

Figure 2-1  Angle of Attack 
 
If the airplane’s speed is too slow, the angle of attack required will be so large that the air can no 
longer follow the upper curvature of the wing.  This results in a swirling, turbulent flow of air 
over the wing and "spoils" the lift.  Consequently, the wing stalls.  On most types of airplanes, 
this critical angle of attack is about 15-20°. 
 
When the propeller rotates, it provides the force to pull the airplane forward.  This forward 
motion causes the airplane to act on the air to produce lift.  The propeller blades, just like a wing, 
are curved on one side and straight on the other side.  Hence, as the engine rotates the propeller, 
forces similar to those of the wing create "lift" in a forward direction.  This is called thrust.  
 
Up to this point, the discussion has related only to the "lifting" force.  Before an understanding of 
how an airplane flies is complete, other forces must be discussed.  
 
2. Gravity.  While the airplane is propelled through the air and sufficient lift is developed to 
sustain it in flight, there are certain other forces acting at the same time.  Every particle of matter, 
including airplanes, is attracted downward towards the center of the earth by gravitational force.  
The amount of this force on the airplane is measured in terms of weight.  If the airplane is to 
keep flying, lift must overcome its weight or gravitational force.  
 
3. Drag.  Another force that constantly acts on the airplane is drag.  Drag is the resistance 
created by air particles striking and flowing around the airplane when it is moving through the 
air.  Aircraft designers constantly try to streamline wings, fuselages and other components to 
reduce the rearward force of drag as much as possible.  The portion of drag caused by form 
resistance and skin friction is termed parasite drag, since it is not the result of the production of 
lift. 
 

--- PAGE 27 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER TWO 
 
T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-3 
A second part of the total drag force is caused by the wing’s lift.  As the wing deflects air to 
produce lift, the total lift force is not exactly vertical, but is tilted slightly rearward.  This means 
that it causes some rearward drag force.  This drag is called induced drag, and is the price paid to 
produce lift.  The larger the angle of attack, the more the lift force on the wing tilts towards the 
rear and the larger the induced drag becomes.  To give the airplane forward motion, thrust must 
overcome drag.  
 
In a steady flight condition (no change in speed or flight path), forces that oppose each other are 
also equal to each other and are always present.  That is, lift equals weight, and thrust equals 
drag. 
 
4. Centrifugal Force.  Still yet another force that frequently acts on the airplane is centrifugal 
force.  However, this force occurs only when the airplane is turning or changing the direction 
(horizontally or vertically) of the flight path.  Another of Newton’s laws of energy states that "a 
body at rest tends to remain at rest, and a body in motion tends to remain moving at the same 
speed and in the same direction . . . " Thus, to make an airplane turn from straight flight, a 
sideward inward force must act upon it.  The tendency of the airplane to keep moving in a 
straight line and outward from a turn is the result of inertia and it produces centrifugal force.  
Therefore, some impeding force is needed to overcome centrifugal force so that the airplane 
moves in the desired direction.  The lift of the wings provides this counteracting force when the 
airplane’s wings are banked in the desired direction.  Refer to the section on Turns in chapter 
three. 
 
Since the airplane is in a banked attitude during a properly executed turn, the pilot will feel the 
centrifugal force by increased seat pressure, rather than the feeling of being forced to the side as 
is experienced in a rapidly turning automobile.  The amount of force (G force) felt by seat 
pressure depends on the angle of bank.  The pilot will, however, be forced to the side of the 
airplane (as in an automobile) if a turn is improperly made and the airplane is made to slip or 
skid.  
 
5. Yaw Forces.  One other force which affects the aircraft during certain conditions of flight 
and which will be frequently referred to in the discussions on various flight maneuvers is torque 
effect or "left turning tendency."  It is probably one of the least understood forces that affect an 
aircraft in flight.  Torque effect is the force which causes the airplane to have a tendency to 
swerve (yaw) to the left, and is created by the clockwise rotation of the engine and the propeller.  
There are four factors that contribute to this yawing tendency:  
 
a. Torque reaction to the engine and propeller. 
 
b. The propeller’s gyroscopic effect. 
 
c. The corkscrewing effect of the propeller slipstream. 
 
d. The asymmetrical loading of the propeller (P-factor). 
 
It is important that pilots understand why these factors contribute to torque effect.  

--- PAGE 28 ---
CHAPTER TWO PRIMARY CONTACT 
2-4    T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS 
a. Torque reaction.  (Figure 2 -2) Torque reaction in a propeller-driven aircraft acts 
opposite the direction of propeller rotation.  In the case of the T-6B, the aircraft tends 
to roll to the left as a result of torque when power is increased, and the aircraft tends 
to roll right when power is reduced.  Rudder and the TAD are the primary means for 
compensating for engine torque. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-2  Torque Effect 
 
b. Gyroscopic Effects.  (Figure 2-3) Gyroscopic reactions are called gyroscopic 
precession.  This occurs when a force is applied to displace a spinning mass such as 
the propeller or, in the case of a spin, the aircraft as a whole.  Gyroscopic precession 
causes an applied force to act in a plane 90° from that in which it was applied (it is 
applied in the same direction as the rotation).  The effect of gyroscopic precession 
depends on the rate of movement about the pitch or yaw axis.  Increased rotation rates 
tend to increase the effect.  This explains why a pilot, who abruptly corrects aircraft 
deviations (pitch, bank, and yaw), ends up frustrated with the adverse effects of 
precession.  The relatively large propeller on the T-6B and high revolutions per 
minute (rpm) result in more precession effect than an aircraft with a lighter, smaller 
propeller turning at slower rpm.  Typical reactions from a clockwise-turning propeller 
(as viewed from the pilot’s seat) include: 
 
- If the nose is yawed to the left, the nose tends to pitch up. 
 
- If the nose is yawed to the right, the nose tends to pitch down. 
 
- If the nose is pitched down, a left yaw tends to develop. 
 
- If the nose is pitched up, a right yaw tends to develop.

Figure 2-3  Gyroscopic Effects 
 
c. Slipstream Effect (Figure 2-4).  The thrust generated by the rotation of the propeller 
induces a phenomenon called corkscrew slipstream effect.  Specifically, the rotating 
prop produces a helical (or corkscrew) shaped air stream about the longitudinal axis.  
This slipstream strikes the wing root, fuselage, and tail surfaces with a constant high-
energy force proportional to power setting and airspeed.  The addition of power 
increases airflow over the tail surfaces and makes them more effective at slow speeds.  
In the T-6B, the corkscrew slipstream induces a slightly higher angle of attack (AOA) 
on the left wing root and left tail surfaces, and slightly lowers AOA on the right wing 
root and right tail surfaces.  This causes the aircraft to yaw to the left when power is 
increased, and requires right rudder input to counter the yaw and maintain 
coordinated flight.  As the power is increased by moving the power control lever 
(PCL) forward with the left hand, the right foot must move forward to counter the 
yaw that is induced to the left.  The amount of rudder movement is proportional to the 
amount and rate of PCL movement.  The amount and rate of rudder movement can be 
determined by looking out the front of the aircraft and using the rudder to keep the 
nose from swinging either left (too little rudder application) or right (too much rudder 
application).  A power reduction has the opposite effect, requiring left rudder to 
maintain coordinated flight.

Figure 2-4  Slipstream Effect 
 
d. P-Factor (Figure 2-5).  P-factor is another effect of the propeller.  It is caused by 
AOA being higher on the downward moving propeller blade than on the upward 
moving propeller blade.  This occurs when the aircraft’s thrust line is above the free 
air stream relative wind or at low speeds and high angles of attack with power-on.  
This moves the aerodynamic center of the propeller to the right of the shaft on a 
clockwise-rotating propeller, causing the aircraft to yaw left as AOA or power is 
increased.  This is why increasing right rudder is required to maintain coordinated 
flight as angle of attack is increased on the aircraft, such as in a pull-up for an over-
the-top aerobatic maneuver.  As the airspeed decreases and the AOA increases, the 
aerodynamic center of the propeller shifts to the right and right rudder is required to 
keep the aircraft in coordinated flight.  The opposite is true when the thrust line is 
below the free air stream relative wind.  The upward-moving propeller blade then has 
a higher angle of attack than the downward-moving blade.  This moves the 
aerodynamic center of the propeller to the left of the shaft on a clockwise-rotating 
propeller, causing the aircraft to yaw to the right and requires left rudder to maintain 
coordinated flight.  A right yawing situation seldom occurs since pushing over to the 
point of shifting the thrust line below the free air stream relative wind is rarely 
warranted.

202. STABILITY AND CONTROL 
 
Most types of naval aircraft have been designed with satisfactory handling qualities in addition to 
adequate performance.  In particular, the T-6B is stable enough to maintain uniform flight 
conditions, recover from disturbances (such as turbulence), and minimize pilot workload.  It has 
sufficient controllability to achieve the desired performance.  However, there are certain 
conditions of flight which produce the most critical requirements of stability and control.  These 
conditions must be understood and respected to accomplish safe and efficient operation of the 
aircraft.  
 
1. Static Stability.  Besides being supported in flight by lift and propelled through the air by 
thrust, an airplane is free to revolve or move around three axes.  These axes may be thought of as 
axes around which the airplane revolves much like a wheel does.  Each axis is perpendicular to 
the other two and all three intersect at the airplane’s center of gravity (CG).  The point around 
which the airplane’s weight is evenly distributed or balanced is considered the CG of the 
airplane.  Figure 2-6 depicts the axes about which the aircraft rotates.

Figure 2-6  Aircraft Axes 
 
An aircraft trimmed for steady flight is in a state of equilibrium.  In other words, the sum of all 
the forces and moments is zero.  Displacement from this position by some outside force, such as 
a gust of turbulence, creates an unbalance and causes the aircraft to demonstrate an initial 
tendency.  This tendency will be to (a) return, (b) be displaced further, or (c) remain in the new 
attitude or position.  This initial tendency is known as static stability.  If the aircraft tends to 
move back in the direction of its trimmed attitude, it is said to be statically stable or to have 
positive static stability.  If the aircraft continues to move away from trimmed equilibrium, it is 
statically unstable or it has negative stability.  An aircraft that stays in its displaced attitude, 
neither moving positively nor negatively, is said to be neutrally stable or neutrally statically 
stable (Figure 2-7).

Figure 2-7  Static Stability 
 
2. Dynamic Stability.  Dynamic stability is the movement of an aircraft with respect to time.  
If an aircraft has been disturbed from its equilibrium position and the maximum displacement 
decreases with time, it is said to have positive dynamic stability.  If the maximum displacement 
increases with time, it is said to have negative dynamic stability.  If the displacement remains 
constant with time, it is said to have neutral dynamic stability.  Both static and dynamic stability 
are usually desired in an airplane.  
 
Static stability does not guarantee that an airplane will also be dynamically stable; however, the 
airplane must first be statically stable before it will oscillate at all and, thus, exhibit any kind of 
dynamic stability.  Possible cases of stability can be summarized in Figure 2-8.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-8  Cases of Stability 
 
In addition to positive static stability, the T-6B has positive dynamic stability.  Over a period of 
time, it will tend to return to most conditions for which it was trimmed.  
 
Let us again consider the ball in the saucer shown in Figure 2-7.  If you move the ball to the 
displaced (dotted) position and then let go, it will not go directly to the equilibrium point and 
stop.  Rather, its inertia will carry it well past the bottom and up the other side.  As gravity 
overcomes its inertial acceleration, it rolls back the other way towards the original displacement 
point until it succumbs again to gravity.  This motion could go on indefinitely if there were no 
friction present between the ball and the dish.  Eventually, friction will reduce the momentum of 

--- PAGE 34 ---
CHAPTER TWO PRIMARY CONTACT 
2-10    T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS 
the ball sufficiently so that it finally settles down once again to the bottom of the dish.  A 
pendulum that is pushed to one side and released displays the same action.  The resulting motion 
is an oscillation (movement from one side of the equilibrium point to the other) until friction 
damps out the motion. 
 
Your instructor will demonstrate the stability characteristics of the T-6B aircraft by trimming for 
straight and level balanced flight.  He will then place the aircraft in various attitudes and permit 
the aircraft to return to straight and level balanced flight, demonstrating the necessity and ease of 
proper use of trim.  As discussed earlier in this chapter, the T-6B is capable of equilibrium flight 
in all airspeeds and configurations that you will encounter.  That is, for all changes in power, 
airspeed, and configurations, the aircraft is able to maintain a "hands-off" straight and level 
balanced flight condition, but will require a CHANGE IN TRIM SETTING for those changes.  
Further discussion on the use of trim will occur later in this chapter.  
 
An aircraft is said to be trimmed if all moments in pitch, roll, and yaw are equal to zero.  The 
establishment of equilibrium at various conditions of flight is the function of the controls and 
will be accomplished by pilot effort and trim tabs.  Pilot effort is necessary to establish 
equilibrium conditions and trim tabs will be used to hold the desired conditions (i.e., reduce 
control pressure).  During training, trim will be of extreme importance and trimming rapidly and 
properly will become a habit.  The necessity to trim the T-6B cannot be overemphasized.  When 
all of the pilot’s energy is consumed fighting the controls, little is left over for flying the aircraft 
and maintaining situational awareness.  
 
Control.  Control is concerned with the maneuverability of the aircraft.  Although the T-6B 
aircraft is "inherently stable" due to its positive and static and dynamic stability, it is not so stable 
as to inhibit aircraft maneuverability.  Since the T-6B is a primary trainer, it was designed to 
have controls capable of aerobatic flight, yet not so sensitive as to make the aircraft difficult to 
control or allow aircraft limits to be easily exceeded.  Generally speaking, control forces are 
highest in the directional axis (ailerons).  The magnitude of these forces varies depending on the 
airspeed, trim setting and the amount of deflection.  At higher speeds, controls become difficult 
to deflect due to higher dynamic pressure impinging on the control surfaces.  Although the 
higher dynamic pressure makes the controls more effective, resulting in a greater aircraft reaction 
for a given control deflection, the forces required to obtain that control deflection are higher.  
Trim setting affects control forces in that the further the aircraft is flown from its trimmed 
airspeed, the greater the forces required (in all axes) to maintain balanced flight conditions.  
These forces serve as physical cues to the pilot that the aircraft has deviated from its trimmed 
airspeed.  
 
203. S TALLS 
 
In earlier discussions it was shown that an airplane would fly as long as the wing is creating 
sufficient lift to counteract the load imposed on it.  When the lift is completely lost the airplane 
stalls.  Remember that the direct cause of every stall is an excessive angle of attack.  There are a 
number of flight maneuvers which may produce an increase in the angle of attack, but the stall 
does not occur until the angle of attack becomes excessive. 
 

--- PAGE 35 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER TWO 
 
T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-11 
It must be emphasized that the stalling speed of a particular airplane is not a fixed value for all 
flight situations.  However, a given airplane will always stall at the same angle of attack 
regardless of airspeed, weight, load factor, or density altitude.  Each airplane has a particular 
angle of attack where the airflow separates from the upper surface of the wing and the stall 
occurs.  Each airplane has only one specific angle of attack where the stall occurs.  The airplane 
can be stalled in straight and level flight by flying too slowly.  As the airspeed is being 
decreased, the angle of attack must be increased to retain the lift required for maintaining 
altitude.  The slower the airspeed becomes, the more the angle of attack must be increased.  
Eventually an angle of attack is reached which will result in the wing not producing enough lift 
to support the airplane and it will start settling.  If the airspeed is reduced further, the airplane 
will stall since the angle of attack has exceeded the critical angle and the airflow over the wing is 
disrupted. 
 
In naval aviation, there is great importance assigned to precise control of an aircraft at high angle 
of attack conditions.  Safe operation in carrier aviation demands the ultimate in precision flying 
at low airspeed.  The aerodynamic lift characteristics of an airplane must be fully understood by 
the Student Naval Aviator  as well as the seasoned "fleet pilot" for obvious safety reasons.  
Additionally, mission requirements and their execution may depend on the pilot’s own 
capabilities and grasp of these basic concepts. 
 
During flight maneuvers, landing approach, takeoff, etc. the airplane will stall IF THE 
CRITICAL ANGLE OF ATTACK IS EXCEEDED.  The airspeed at which stall occurs will 
be determined by weight, load factor, altitude, and configuration, but the stall angle of attack 
remains unaffected.  At any particular altitude, the indicated stall speed is a function of weight 
and load factor.  An increase in altitude will produce a decrease in density and an increase in true 
airspeed.  Also, an increase in altitude will alter compressibility and airflow viscosity, which will 
cause the indicated stall speeds to increase. 
 
Modern airplanes are characterized by having a large percentage of their maximum gross weight 
as fuel.  Most Navy inventory aircraft carry 25-40% of their total gross weight in this manner.  
Hence, the gross weight and stall speed of the airplane can vary considerably throughout the 
flight.  A general "rule of thumb" is that a 2% change in weight will cause a 1% change in stall 
speed. 
 
Load factor/centrifugal force.  Turning flight and maneuvers produce an effect on stall speed, 
which is similar to the effect of weight.  The stalling speed of an airplane is higher in a level turn 
than in straight and level flight.  This is because centrifugal force is added to the airplane’s 
weight, and the wing must produce sufficient additional lift to counterbalance the load imposed 
by the combination of centrifugal force and weight.  In a turn, the necessary additional lift is 
acquired by applying back pressure to the elevator control.  This increases the wing’s angle of 
attack, and results in increased lift.  As stated earlier, the angle of attack must increase as the 
bank angle increases to counteract the increasing load caused by centrifugal force.  If at any time 
during a turn the angle of attack becomes excessive, the airplane will stall.  Thus, the aircraft in a 
steady turn still develops lift greater than weight, but experiences increased stall speeds due to 
load factor increases.  This fact emphasizes the need to avoid steep turns at low airspeeds - a 
flight condition common to stall/spin accidents.  (Refer to NATOPS V
n Diagram.) 

--- PAGE 36 ---
CHAPTER TWO PRIMARY CONTACT 
2-12    T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS 
It must be reemphasized here that low speed is not necessary to produce a stall.  The wing can be 
brought into an excessive angle of attack at any speed.  For example, take the case of an airplane 
which is in a dive with an airspeed of 200 KIAS, when suddenly the pilot pulls back sharply on 
the elevator control.  Because of gravity and centrifugal force, the airplane could not 
immediately alter its flight path, but would merely change its angle of attack abruptly from quite 
low to very high.  Since the flight path of the airplane, in relation to the oncoming air, determines 
the direction of the relative wind, the angle of attack is suddenly increased, and the airplane will 
quickly reach the stalling angle at a speed much greater than normal stall speed.  
 
The primary purpose of high lift devices (i.e., flaps, slats, and slots) is to increase the coefficient 
of lift and reduce the stall speed for an airplane.  Therefore, flap extension increases the total lift 
available and reduces the angle of attack for any given lift coefficient.  
 
At this point we should examine the action of the airplane during a stall.  In our earlier 
discussion of pitching (longitudinal) stability, we learned that to balance the airplane 
aerodynamically, the center of lift is normally located aft of the center of gravity.  It should be 
noted that although this airplane is inherently "nose heavy," downwash on the horizontal 
stabilizer counteracts this condition.  It can be seen then, that at the point of stall when the 
upward force of the wing’s lift and the downward tail force cease, an unbalanced condition 
exists.  This allows the airplane to pitch down abruptly, rotating about its center of gravity. 
During this nose down attitude, the angle of attack decreases and the airspeed again increases; 
hence, the smooth flow of air over the wing begins again, lift returns, and the airplane is again 
flying.  However, considerable altitude may be lost before this cycle is complete.  
 
The associated loss of altitude and control response in the stalled configuration has meant the 
lives of both students and seasoned naval aviators.  A stall never checks anyone’s logbook or 
qualifications before it decides to happen.  Therefore, it is important to remember that the stall is 
not merely a precision maneuver, but an actual situation into which you may inadvertently fly 
while concentrating on some other aspect of your flying. 
 
204. PRIMARY FLIGHT CONTROLS  
 
To maneuver an aircraft, you will learn to control its movement about its lateral, longitudinal, 
and vertical axes (Figure 2-9).  This is accomplished by the use of the flight controls (elevators, 
ailerons, and rudder), which can be deflected from their neutral position into the flow of air as 
the aircraft moves forward.  In flight, the controls have a natural live “feel” due to the force of 
the airflow around them.  With this in mind, the student should think of exerting force against 
this live pressure or resistance not of moving the flight controls.

Figure 2-9  Aircraft Axes 
 
Elevators 
 
The elevators control the aircraft’s movement about its lateral axis.  They form the rear part of 
the horizontal stabilizer, are free to be moved up and down by the pilot, and are connected to a 
control stick in the cockpit by means of cables and pulleys.  Applying forward pressure on the 
stick causes the elevator surfaces to move downward.  The flow of air striking the deflected 
elevator surfaces exerts an upward force, pushing the aircraft’s tail upward and the nose 
downward.  Conversely, exerting back pressure on the control causes the elevator surfaces to 
move up, exerting a downward force to push the tail downward and the nose upward.  In effect, 
the elevators are the angle-of-attack (AOA) control.  When back pressure is applied on the 
control, the tail lowers and the nose rises, thus increasing the wing’s AOA and lift.  
 
Ailerons 
 
The ailerons control the aircraft’s movement about its longitudinal axis (Figure 2-10).  There are 
two ailerons, one at the trailing edge of each wing, near the wingtips.  They are movable surfaces 
hinged to the wing’s rear spar and are linked together by cables so that when one aileron is 
deflected down, the opposite aileron moves up.  The ailerons are statically mass balanced with 
weights installed on the leading edges of each aileron.  
 
The two wings produce differences in the lift that actually turns the aircraft.  To obtain the 
horizontal component of lift required to pull the aircraft in the desired direction of turn, apply 
lateral control stick force in that direction.  When the pilot applies pressure to the left on the 

--- PAGE 38 ---
CHAPTER TWO PRIMARY CONTACT 
2-14    T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS 
control stick, the right aileron surface deflects downward and the left aileron deflects upward.  
The force exerted by the airflow on the deflected surfaces raises the right wing and lowers the 
left wing.  This happens because the downward deflection of the right aileron changes the wing 
camber and increases the AOA and lift on that wing.  Simultaneously, the left aileron moves 
upward and changes the effective camber, resulting in a decreased AOA and less lift.  Thus, 
decreased lift on the left wing and increased lift on the right causes the aircraft to bank to the left. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-10  Aileron Control 
 
Adverse Yaw (Figure 2-11):  Since the downward deflected aileron produces more lift, it also 
produces more drag, while the opposite aileron has less lift and less drag.  This added drag 
attempts to pull or veer the airplane’s nose in the direction of the raised wing; that is, it tries to 
turn the airplane in the direction opposite to that desired.  This undesired veering is referred to as 
adverse yaw. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-11  Adverse Yaw

PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER TWO 
 
T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-15 
To demonstrate this in flight, an attempt can be made to turn to the right without using the rudder 
pedals.  As right aileron pressure is applied, the airplane rolls into a right bank and tries to turn to 
the right.  But the adverse yaw, or the drag on the downward deflected left aileron, pulls the 
airplane’s nose to the left.  The airplane banks, but it turns hesitantly and sideslips.  This is 
undesirable and corrective action should be taken by applying right rudder pressure. 
 
When right rudder pressure is applied simultaneously with right aileron pressure, it keeps the 
airplane from yawing opposite to the desired direction of turn.  In fact, the rudder must be used 
because the ailerons were used.  Coordinated use of the rudder with the ailerons in a turn will 
counteract the effects of adverse yaw. 
 
Adverse yaw is an undesirable effect, and is most apparent at low speeds and extreme control-
surface deflections.  At faster airspeeds, adverse yaw becomes less apparent and may be 
unnoticeable.  When accomplishing slow flight, watch closely for the effects of adverse yaw in 
the turn.  Your instructor can share methods on how to appropriately use the rudder while 
initiating a turn to counter adverse yaw effects. 
 
Rudder.  The rudder controls the aircraft’s movement about its vertical axis.  This motion is 
called yaw.  Like the other primary control surfaces, the rudder is a movable surface hinged to a 
fixed surface in this case to the vertical stabilizer.  Left and right rudder pedals control rudder 
movement.  Its action is much like that of the elevators, except the motion is side to side instead 
of up and down.  When the rudder is deflected to one side, it protrudes into the airflow, causing a 
horizontal force to be exerted in the opposite direction.  This pushes the tail of the aircraft in that 
direction and yaws the nose in the desired direction.  For example: when the rudder is deflected 
to the left, it protrudes into the airflow on the left side of the tail, causing a horizontal force to be 
exerted on the tail to the right.  This pushes the tail of the aircraft to the right and yaws the nose 
to the left. 
 
The primary purpose of the rudder in flight is to counteract the effect of adverse yaw and to help 
provide directional control of the airplane.  In flight, the rudder does not turn the airplane; 
instead, the force of the horizontal component of wing lift turns the airplane when the wings are 
banked.  As in the demonstration of turning by use of ailerons alone, this can be verified by 
flying straight and level and then, after taking the hands off the control stick, trying to turn to the 
right by applying right rudder pressure only.  At first it may seem to work pretty well.  The 
airplane will turn to the right, but it will also skid to the left (a skid in a turn is an unbalanced 
flight condition caused by insufficient angle of bank for a given radius of turn).  Since the 
airplane possesses inherent stability, it will tend to stop the skid by banking itself to the right. 
 
If the pilot were now to neutralize the rudder, only a shallow banking turn would result.  
However, inasmuch as the purpose of this demonstration is to make a turn using only the rudder, 
continue to hold right rudder pressure.  Since the airplane is slightly banked to the right, the 
rudder will force the nose of the airplane downward to the right.  The reason for this is that 
yawing is the only movement the rudder can produce.  As a result, the nose yaws downward, the 
airspeed increases, and the airplane starts losing altitude.  At the same time, the airplane, being 
stable, attempts to stop the increased skidding by banking more steeply.  The more steeply it 
banks, the more the nose is yawed downward by the right rudder action.  The net result of

holding rudder alone is a descending spiral unless back elevator pressure is applied.  Thus, it can 
be seen that rudder alone cannot produce a balanced turn.  Coordinated application of aileron, 
rudder, and elevator pressure will produce a balanced flight condition. 
 
On the ground, the T-6B rudder pedals manipulate the nose wheel steering (if engaged), which is 
used to directionally control the aircraft while taxiing.  Taxiing will be discussed in greater detail 
in Chapter Four, Ground Procedures. 
 
Primary Control Application.  The following will always be true in controlled flight, 
regardless of the airplane’s attitude in relation to the earth:  
 
1. When backpressure is applied to the elevator control, the airplane’s nose rises in relation to 
the pilot.  
 
2. When forward pressure is applied to the elevator control, the airplane’s nose lowers in 
relation to the pilot.  
 
3. When right pressure is applied to the aileron control, the airplane’s right wing lowers in 
relation to the pilot.  
 
4. When left pressure is applied to the aileron control, the airplane’s left wing lowers in 
relation to the pilot.  
 
5. When pressure is applied to the right rudder pedal, the airplane’s nose moves to the right in 
relation to the pilot.  
 
6. When pressure is applied to the left rudder pedal, the airplane’s nose moves to the left in 
relation to the pilot.  
 
205. SECONDARY FLIGHT CONTROLS - TRIM DEVICES  
 
The secondary flight controls include electrically actuated pitch/roll/yaw trim systems and a 
rudder trim aid device (TAD).  The secondary flight controls are used for trimming and 
balancing the aircraft in flight and to reduce the force required to actuate the primary flight 
control surfaces.  
 
Trimming the aircraft is an essential skill for you to master and its importance is often 
overlooked by fledging aviators.  When an aircraft’s flight conditions (attitude, power, airspeed, 
loading and configuration) are changed, the control pressures required to maintain the desired 
conditions are affected by the resulting changes in aerodynamic forces.  The T-6B is equipped 
with systems that allow you to trim the aircraft for balanced flight in all axes.  
 
Trim System and Switches  
 
The elevator and aileron trim are utilized by a thumb-actuated switch (Figure 2-12) at the top of 
the control stick (fore/aft for elevator trim and laterally for aileron trim).  The rudder trim switch 
is located on the forward side of the power control lever (PCL).  To trim, deflect the trim switch 

--- PAGE 41 ---

T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-17 
in the opposite direction as the applied flight control force until that force is relieved.  When 
perfectly “trimmed,” you can release flight control pressures (momentarily) and the aircraft will 
remain in its current balanced state.  The Trim Interrupt button on the control stick will remove 
electrical power from the trim devices and is used during certain trim malfunctions.  The general 
sequence for trimming the aircraft is: Rudder, Elevator and then Aileron.  The rudder trim is 
usually first because a correction for yaw precipitates a change in the trim setting for pitch and 
roll.  Consequently, not trimming the rudder first will generally cause you to go back and re-trim 
the elevator and aileron after trimming the rudder. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-12  Control Stick 
 
Rudder trim: an electromechanical actuator located in the vertical stabilizer, which drives an 
anti-servo trim tab on the trailing edge of the rudder provides rudder trim.  Reference the balance 
ball of the turn and slip indicator to help determine the proper direction of rudder and rudder trim 
pressure.  For example, if the ball is out to the right, the nose is actually out to the left and you 
are in unbalanced flight.  Smoothly apply right rudder pressure (“Step On The Ball”) to regain 
balanced flight.  Then smoothly apply right rudder trim until you relieve the rudder pressure you 
are holding.  If you have trimmed properly, the ball should stay in the center and you should feel 
as if you are flying straight and level. 
 
TAD:  the rudder TAD of the T-6B assists in trimming about the yaw axis of the aircraft.  The 
inputs to the TAD include engine torque, altitude, airspeed, and pitch rate.  Based on these 
inputs, the TAD sends a signal to the rudder trim actuator physically moving the trim tab surface 
to a computed position.  Although the TAD is effective at approximating a valid rudder trim 
position, it by no means replaces the need to appropriately trim the rudder, especially during 
rapid accelerations and large power changes. 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 42 ---
CHAPTER TWO PRIMARY CONTACT 
2-18    T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS 
Remember any pilot-actuated electric rudder trim inputs are additive to the trim input the TAD 
commands.  Thus, a good method during minor trim changes is to allow the TAD to complete its 
trim cycle, then make fine adjustments as necessary.  Loss of the TAD in flight does not affect 
the overall controllability of the aircraft and its loss would minimally impact most training 
missions.  
 
Elevator trim: elevator trim is provided by an electromechanical actuator which drives a tab 
surface on the right side of the elevator.  To trim the aircraft nose attitude, first move the stick to 
position the nose for the attitude you desire in relationship to the horizon.  As the fore/aft stick 
force increases, maintain the desired nose attitude and apply elevator trim in the opposite 
direction as the control pressure until it is relieved.  Always use a light grip on the stick so as to 
“feel” the pressure.  “Finger-tip control” is the key to smooth flying.  
 
Aileron trim:  the aileron trim is utilized much like the elevator trim but about the longitudinal, 
or roll, axis of the aircraft.  Interestingly, unlike the other two trim systems that utilize trim tab 
surfaces on their training edges (rudder and elevator), aileron trim in the T-6B is accomplished 
by physical movement of the ailerons.  Ground adjustable trim tabs are installed on the trailing 
edge of each aileron to allow maintenance personnel to adjust the “neutral” setting.  Aileron trim 
is only necessary if, after the rudder is trimmed, the aircraft tends to roll to one side.  
 
206. TRIM REQUIREMENTS - RUDDER/ELEVATOR 
 
Acceleration LEFT/DOWN 
Deceleration RIGHT/UP 
Power Addition RIGHT/DOWN 
Power Reduction LEFT/UP 
 
When airspeed is increased (with power unchanged), the nose will have a tendency to rise and 
the aircraft will yaw slightly to the right; consequently, we need to add left (rudder) and down 
(nose down) trim.  If power is unchanged and airspeed is reduced, we see from the box above 
that right rudder trim and up elevator trim is needed.  If airspeed is constant and power is 
increased, then right rudder trim and down elevator trim is needed.  If power is reduced with 
airspeed constant, then left rudder trim and up elevator trim are necessary.  
 
Aside from these four basic scenarios, many flight maneuvers combine two of the “rules” 
simultaneously.  For example, when initiating a 180 knot climb from normal cruise (200 knots, 
level), you add power, raise the nose, and decelerate.  In this case, right rudder trim is required 
for both the power addition and deceleration.  However, the requirement conflicts on what to do 
with the elevator (power addition = nose down/deceleration = nose up).  In this example, trim 
“nose up” because, generally speaking, in opposing situations such as this one, airspeed will 
have a greater and more lasting effect on the elevator and rudder trim.  Therefore, as a common 
trim rule, “Airspeed trumps Power.”

T-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-19 
207. PERFORMANCE 
 
Remember this simple formula:  POWER + ATTITUDE = PERFORMANCE  
 
Most early basic air work problems result from the inability to properly see and control the 
aircraft’s attitude, in correlation to the power applied by the engine.  Only after you master 
proper attitude control will you begin to develop solid basic flying skills.  
 
Coordinated use of all controls is very important in any turn.  Applying aileron pressure places 
the aircraft in the desired angle of bank (AOB), while simultaneous application of rudder 
pressure is required to counteract the resultant adverse yaw.  During a turn, the AOA must be 
increased by adding back-stick pressure (increasing elevator deflection) to compensate for the 
loss of lift due to bank.  Thus, the steeper the turn, the more back elevator pressure is needed to 
maintain level flight, accompanied by a corresponding increase in G load.  Varying greatly 
among different flight regimes, the actual amount of deflection of the control surfaces is of little 
importance as long as you reach the desired result.  
 
When using the rudder pedals, pressure should be applied smoothly and evenly by pressing with 
the ball of one foot just as when using the brakes of an automobile.  The rudder pedals are 
interconnected and act in opposite directions; when pressure is applied to one pedal, pressure on 
the other must be relaxed proportionally.  For positioning, comfortably rest the balls of your feet 
against the lower portion of the rudder pedals while supporting the weight of your feet on the 
cockpit floor.  The pedals should be adjusted so that full throw is available with a slight flex in 
the knee. 
 
208. POWER CONTROL LEVER 
 
The PCL controls the power output of the engine (Figure 2-13).  This power, transmitted through 
the propeller, produces thrust.  As discussed in the previous chapter, this thrust will propel the 
aircraft through the air, developing lift.  When sufficient power is combined with the appropriate 
angle of attack, the desired performance is obtained. 
 
Moving the PCL forward increases power; moving it aft decreases power.  If a constant airspeed 
is maintained with adjustments in the attitude relative to the horizon, a variation in power will 
control the gain or loss of altitude.  This concept of control establishes a basic fundamental of the 
mechanics of any powered flight. 
 
The PCL should be operated firmly but smoothly.  You will learn to set the desired power with 
your peripheral vision and then go back and fine-tune the power as required for a particular 
maneuver.  Occasionally check to see that the desired power setting is still in fact set.

FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS    3-1 
CHAPTER THREE 
FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
 
300. INTRODUCTION 
 
This section discusses and explains the fundamental flight maneuvers upon which all flying tasks 
and procedures are based.  In learning to fly, as in any learning process, fundamentals must be 
mastered before the more advanced phases can be learned.  
 
301. FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT MANEUVERS 
 
Maneuvering of the airplane is generally divided into four flight fundamentals:  
 
1. Straight and level flight 
 
2. Turns 
 
3. Climbs 
 
4. Descents 
 
All controlled flight consists of any one or a combination of these basic maneuvers.  Proper 
control of an airplane’s attitude is the result of the pilot knowing when and how much to change 
it, and then smoothly making the required correction.  When flying by reference to objects 
outside the airplane, the effects of the pilot’s control application on the airplane’s flight attitude 
can be seen by observing the relationship of the position of some portion of the airplane to the 
outside references. 
 
At first, control of the airplane is a matter of consciously fixing the relationship of a specific 
reference point on the airplane to the horizon.  As basic flight skills are developed through 
experience and training, the pilot will acquire a continuous awareness of these relationships 
without conscious effort.  The reference points will be used almost subconsciously in varying 
degrees to determine the attitude of the airplane during all maneuvers.  
 
In establishing the reference points, the airplane should be placed approximately in the desired 
attitude, and then a specific point should be selected.  No two pilots see this relationship exactly 
the same.  The apparent position of reference points will depend on each pilot’s seat height and 
lateral position, and/or the pilot’s eye level and line of sight.  It is imperative that the student 
utilize the same seat position on each flight so that the reference points remain the same.  
 
302. INTEGRATED FLIGHT INSTRUCTION 
 
In introducing the basic flight maneuvers, the "integrated flight instruction" method will be used.  
This means that each flight maneuver will be performed by using both outside visual references 
and the flight instruments.  
 
 

--- PAGE 46 ---
CHAPTER THREE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
3-2    FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
When pilots use this method, they achieve a more precise and competent overall piloting ability.  
It results in less difficulty in holding desired altitudes, controlling airspeed during takeoffs, 
climbs, descents, and landing approaches, and in maintaining headings in the traffic pattern, as 
well as on cross-country flights.  
 
The use of integrated flight instruction does not, and is not intended to, prepare pilots for flight in 
instrument weather conditions.  It does, however, provide an excellent foundation for flight 
during Instrument Navigation stage of training, and will result in the pilot becoming a more 
accurate, competent, and safe pilot.  
 
A sharp lookout for other aircraft must be maintained at all times, particularly when using 
instrument references, to avoid the possibility of a collision.  Frequently, other aircraft are 
unnoticed until they suddenly appear within the limited area of the pilot’s vision.  Consequently, 
it is imperative that the pilot not only divide attention between controlling the airplane by outside 
visual references and flight instruments, but also be observant of other aircraft.  For visual flight, 
the pilot’s scan should be directed outside the cockpit at least 80 - 90% of the time!  
 
303. ATTITUDE FLYING 
 
Airplane control is composed of four components:  
 
1. Pitch control:  Pitch control is the control of the airplane (longitudinal axis) about its 
lateral axis by applying elevator pressure to raise or lower the nose, usually in relation to the 
horizon.  
 
2. Bank control:  Bank control is the control of the airplane (lateral axis) about its 
longitudinal axis by use of the ailerons to attain the desired angle of bank in relation to the 
horizon.  
 
3. Yaw control:  Yaw control is the control of the aircraft (longitudinal axis) about its vertical 
axis by use of the rudder.  
 
4. Power control:  Power control is the control of power or thrust by use of the PCL to 
establish or maintain desired airspeeds in coordination with the attitude changes.  
 
The Primary Flight Display (PFD) displays both the pitch and bank attitude of the aircraft and 
shows the aircraft’s direction of flight.  
 
1. The attitude indicator shows directly both the pitch and bank attitude of the airplane. 
 
2. The heading indicator shows directly the airplane’s direction of flight.  
 
3. The altimeter indicates the airplane’s altitude and, indirectly, the need for a pitch change.  
 
4. The vertical speed indicator shows the rate of climb or descent.  
 

--- PAGE 47 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER THREE 
 
FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS    3-3 
5. The airspeed indicator shows the results of power and/or pitch changes in the airplane’s 
speed.  
 
The outside visual references used in controlling the airplane include the airplane’s nose and 
wingtips to show both the airplane’s pitch attitude and flight direction with the wings and frame 
of the windscreen showing the angle of bank. 
 
304. "SEE AND AVOID" DOCTRINE 
 
Simply stated, the "See and Avoid" Doctrine is a pilot’s best defense against a midair collision.  
The "Big Sky, Little Airplane" theory is the key ingredient in the recipe for a midair collision. 
The causal factor most often noted in aircraft accident reports involving midair collisions is, 
"failure of the pilot to see and avoid the other aircraft."  In most cases, at least one of the pilots 
involved could have seen the other in time to avoid contact if he had been using his eyes 
properly. 
 
Studies show that nearly all midair collisions occur during daylight hours, in VMC weather.  
Most midairs occur within five miles of an airport, in the areas of greatest traffic concentration, 
and usually on warm, weekend days.  Most midairs also involve maneuvers that are classified as 
crossing or overtaking.  Very rarely are head-on collisions reported. 
 
It is also noteworthy to find that the closing speed (rate at which two aircraft approach each 
other) in a crossing or overtaking maneuver is often relatively slow, usually much slower than 
the airspeed of either aircraft involved.  Again, that is because the majority of midair collisions 
are the result of a faster aircraft overtaking and striking a slower one. 
 
Studies also reveal some interesting information regarding the vulnerabilities of the human eye 
and how its limitations contribute to midair collisions. 
 
The eye, and consequently vision, is vulnerable to just about everything: dust, fatigue, emotion, 
germs, fallen eyelashes, age, optical illusions and alcoholic content.  In flight, our vision is 
affected by atmospheric conditions, windscreen distortion, too much or too little oxygen, 
acceleration, glare, heat, lighting and aircraft design.  Most importantly, the eye is vulnerable to 
the vagaries of the mind.  We "see" and identify only what the mind lets us see.  For example, a 
daydreaming pilot staring into space sees no approaching traffic and is a number one candidate 
for a midair collision. 
 
A constant problem source to the pilot (though he is probably never aware of it) is the time 
required for "accommodation."  Our eyes automatically accommodate for (or focus on) near and 
far objects.  But the change from something up close, like a dark panel two feet away, to a well-
lighted landmark or an aircraft target a mile or so away, takes one to two seconds or longer for 
eye accommodation.  That can be a long time when you consider that you need 10 seconds to  
avoid a midair collision. 
 
Another focusing problem occurs on drab, colorless days above a haze or cloud layer when no 
distinct horizon is visible.  If there is little or nothing to focus on, we do not focus at all.  We 

--- PAGE 48 ---
CHAPTER THREE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
3-4    FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
experience something known as "empty-field myopia;" we stare but see nothing, not even 
opposing traffic. 
 
The effects of "binocular vision" have been studied by the National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) during investigations of midair collisions.  The board concluded that this is also a causal 
factor.  To actually accept what we see, we need to receive cues from both eyes.  If an object is 
visible to one eye, but hidden from the other by a windscreen post or other obstruction, the total 
image is blurred and not always accepted by the mind. 
 
Another inherent eye problem is that of narrow field of vision.  Although our eyes accept light 
rays from an arc of nearly 200º, they are limited to a relatively narrow area (approximately  
10-15º) in which they can actually focus on and classify an object.  Though we can perceive 
movement in the periphery, we cannot identify what is there.  We tend not to believe what we 
see out of the corner of our eyes.  This often leads to "tunnel vision." 
 
That limitation is compounded by the fact that at a distance, an aircraft on a collision course will 
appear to be motionless.  It will remain in a seemingly stationary position, without appearing 
either to move or to grow in size for a relatively long time, and then suddenly bloom into a huge 
mass filling the canopy.  This is known as "blossom effect."  We need motion or contrast to 
attract our eyes’ attention.  A large bug smear or dirty spot on the windscreen can hide a 
converging plane until it is too close to be avoided. 
 
In addition to built-in problems, the eye is also severely limited by environment.  Optical 
properties of the atmosphere alter the appearance of traffic, particularly on hazy days.  "Limited 
visibility" actually means "limited vision."  You may be legally Visual Flight Rules (VFR) when 
you have three miles visibility, but at that distance, on a hazy day, opposing traffic is not easy to 
detect.  At a range closer than three miles, even though detectable, opposing traffic may not be 
avoidable.  
 
Lighting also affects our vision.  Glare, usually worse on a sunny day over a cloud deck or 
during flight directly into the sun, makes objects hard to see and scanning uncomfortable.  Also, 
a well-lighted object will have a high degree of contrast and be easy to detect, while one with 
low contrast at the same distance may be impossible to see.  For instance, when the sun is behind 
you, an opposing aircraft will stand out clearly, but when you are looking into the sun, and your 
traffic is "back-lighted," it is much more difficult to see. 
 
A contrast problem exists when trying to see an airplane against a cluttered background.  If an 
aircraft is between you and terrain that is varied in color or heavily dotted with buildings, it will 
blend into the background until it becomes quite close. 
 
So what can we do to overcome the vulnerabilities of the eye?  The most important thing is to 
develop a scan that is both comfortable and workable for your own airplane.  In normal flight, 
the threat of a midair collision is greatly diminished by scanning an area 60º either side of center 
and 10º up and down.  Refer to Figure 3-1.  This does not mean that the rest of the area should be 
ignored.

Figure 3-1  Outside Scan 
 
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) can enhance a pilot’s visual scan by detecting 
several aircraft simultaneously.  Depending upon the mode selected, a series of traffic advisory 
symbols (see T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual) may appear, enabling earlier visual detection of 
possible conflicting traffic.  In this way the TCAS effectively complements but does not replace 
the VFR scan, which remains the pilot’s primary means to see and avoid conflicting traffic.  
 
Many times the threat of an impending midair collision is evident early enough for the aircrew to 
discuss the threat and coordinate a decision regarding deviation from the flight path to avoid it. 
However, this will not always be the case.  The other aircraft may be sighted at a point which 
will prevent discussion with, or even notification of, the other crewmember.  This would require 
immediate action!  In such a situation, students are expected to take the controls and/or initiate a 
deviation in either bank, pitch or power (or combination of these) to displace the aircraft from its 
current flight path in order to avoid the collision.  This concept holds true even if the deviation 
involves either high positive or negative "G" loads.  Avoiding the collision takes priority over 
preventing an overstress!  This situation should be addressed during the preflight briefing.  If a 
TCAS advisory is encountered outside the landing pattern, cease dynamic maneuvering and 
attempt to gain visual contact with traffic.  Do not make a traffic avoidance maneuver solely 
based on TCAS until you have acquired the traffic visually. 
 
305. FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS 
 
Of the basic skills required for flight, instrument interpretation requires the most thorough study 
and analysis.  It begins with your understanding of each instrument’s construction and operating 
principles.  Then you must apply this knowledge to the performance of the aircraft you are 
flying, the particular maneuvers to be executed, the scan and control methods, and the flight 
conditions in which you are operating.  For each maneuver, you will learn what performance to  
expect and the combination of items that you must interpret in order to control aircraft attitude 
during the maneuver.

For flight that is not restricted to cockpit references for setting aircraft attitudes, the following 
flight instruments (located on the PFD) will comprise the group to be used as "crosscheck" or 
performance instruments in succeeding chapters:  
 
1. Attitude Indicator 
 
2. Altimeter 
 
3. Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  
 
4. Airspeed Indicator 
 
5. Heading Indicator  
 
6. Turn and Bank Indicator (Turn needle and ball)  
 
NOTE 
 
For a complete discussion of these instruments, refer to the T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual Chapter I.  
 
306. SCAN PATTERN 
 
The tool that all pilots must employ to guard against midair collisions is an efficient scan pattern. 
Division of attention, or scanning, is the "awareness" that a pilot must possess in order to fly 
his/her aircraft effectively.  It is quite obvious that you must: 
 
1. Look outside the airplane to see where you are going. 
 
2. Look at the aircraft with respect to the horizon to check a nd maintain a desired attitude. 
 
3. Look inside the aircraft to check for proper power settings, flight instrument readings and   
any signs of malfunctions. 
 
Combined with the diversified attention involved in the fundamental control of the aircraft is the 
concern that must be devoted to flight safety: avoiding other aircraft.  Behind the proper 
division-of-attention methods, which you learn in training, lies the foundation for the mandatory 
alertness of the military pilot. 
 
It might seem that the task of having to be aware of so many events and circumstances at the 
same time is impossible.  However, the ability to do so is an integral part of your flight training 
and can be developed naturally.  Of course, as in any endeavor, its development is expedited by a 
conscientious effort to learn. 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 51 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER THREE 
 
FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS    3-7 
In order to divide your attention, your development of an efficient scan pattern will offer the 
most efficient means by which you can readily ascertain required information and not dwell on 
any one item with subsequent failure to notice other equally important details. 
 
A scan pattern is a means, or procedure, by which you can observe everything you need to see by 
starting at one point, moving visually about the aircraft, checking all applicable items 
systematically and thoroughly and completing the pattern at the starting point.  A scan pattern 
may be started anywhere, but it must be complete and continuous. 
 
What we refer to as the integrated scan involves combining contact flying and flight instruments 
through a systematic pattern.  The task of scanning in contact flying (VMC) involves division of 
attention between the external and internal environment, setting attitudes with the nose and 
wings in relation to the horizon and cross-checking them against the instruments in the cockpit.  
The following scan pattern is a workable example: 
 
1. Outside the cockpit: 
a. Attitude and area - Nose in proper relation to horizon and geographical references for 
heading and position.  
b. Area - Airspace between nose and left wing clear of hazards. 
c. Attitude - Left wing in proper relation to horizon. 
 
2. Inside the cockpit: 
a. Attitude - Check wings level with PFD and correct nose position with the altimeter 
and VSI.  
b. Performance - Check airspeed indicator and power setting. 
 
3. Outside the cockpit: 
a. Attitude and area - Nose in proper relation to horizon and geographical refer ences for 
heading and position. 
b. Area - Airspace between nose and right wing clear of hazards. 
c. Attitude - Right wing in proper relation to horizon. 
 
As a beginner, you may crosscheck rapidly by "looking" without knowing exactly what you are 
looking for, but with increasing familiarity with the maneuvers and experience with the support 
instruments, you will learn:  
 
What to look for, 
When to look for it, and 
What response is required. 
 
As proficiency increases, you will scan primarily from habit by adjusting your scanning rate and 
sequence to the demands of the situation.  The scan requirements will vary from maneuver to 
maneuver, so initially the scanning process will seem new and somewhat unnatural.  It cannot be

overemphasized, however, that your level of success in flight training will vary proportionately 
with your ability to force yourself to develop and maintain a correct and expeditious scan pattern. 
 
The entire pattern should take very little time and no one item should fix your attention at the 
exclusion of another.  Meanwhile, corrections should be initiated for any errors detected and the 
next scan over the pattern will enable you to further correct or perfect your condition of flight. 
 
There are other methods of scanning, some of which may be more effective for you than the 
preceding type.  Figures 3-2 and 3-3 illustrate other frequently utilized outside scan patterns.

Figure 3-3  Front-to-Side Scanning Method 
 
An equally effective scan pattern is the front-to-side method illustrated in Figure 3-3.  In this 
pattern, start in the center block of your visual field (center of front windscreen), move to left 
focusing in each block, then, after reaching the last block on the left, swing quickly back to the 
center block and repeat the performance to the right.  At the end of the scan, return to the panel. 
There are no real advantages or disadvantages of one method over the other.  Use the method 
that works best for you. 
 
In order to establish an efficient and useful scan in flight, one also has to establish a good 
internal (instrument) scan and learn to give each instrument its proper share of time.  The amount 
of time spent scanning outside the cockpit in relationship to inside depends on cockpit workload 
and traffic density. 
 
Remember, while you are looking at the instruments, the nose attitude and wing position may 
become erratic, and while you look at the nose position and correct it, the instrument readings 
may vary.  You cannot afford to gaze at any one item for any length of time or the pattern will be 
broken (this is referred to as "fixating").  Instead, scan each position, initiate corrections, and 
then check those corrections when you return to that position in the scan pattern.  Be alert!  Look 
around!  Remember that under you is a blind spot.  Never assume that others see you! 
 
307. BALANCED FLIGHT 
 
Balanced flight exists when the aircraft is neither in a slip nor a skid as it progresses along a 
flight path.  With respect to balanced flight, there are two principles of control application: 
 

--- PAGE 54 ---
CHAPTER THREE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
3-10    FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
1. Any control deflection will result in an attitude change until the control is returned to 
neutral. 
 
2. There is a definite aerodynamic interrelationship between the rudder and aileron to 
maintain balanced flight. 
 
For an aircraft to be in a balanced flight condition, the controls must be applied so that the 
longitudinal axis lies in the plane of forward motion.  The utilization of either the rudder or the 
ailerons, independent of one another, will result in a condition of unbalanced flight.  The "turn  
and bank" indicator indicates an unbalanced condition by moving away from the center position 
in the direction of the slip or skid.  The pilot can also recognize this condition by an awareness of 
a sensation of side motion.  The side motion causes a tendency to lean in the direction of the slip 
or skid.  This unbalanced condition can be corrected by the proper application of the rudder, 
ailerons, or both.  
 
308. TURNS 
 
The turn is the most complex of all the basic flight maneuvers.  During the turn, coordinated use 
of all three flight controls is required.  Although there are other important considerations, the 
first requirement for the turn is that balanced flight be maintained. 
 
You will recall that when an airplane is flying straight and level, the total lift is acting 
perpendicular to the wings and to the earth.  As the airplane is banked into a turn, the lift then 
becomes the resultant of two components.  One, the vertical component, continues to act 
perpendicular to the earth and opposes gravity.  The other, the horizontal component, acts 
parallel to the earth’s surface and opposes centrifugal force caused by the turn.  These two lift 
components act at right angles to each other, causing the resultant lifting force to act 
perpendicular to the banked wings of the airplane.  It is this lifting force that actually turns the 
airplane, not the rudder. 
 
When applying aileron to bank the airplane, the depressed or lowered aileron (on the rising wing) 
produces a greater drag than the raised aileron (on the lowering wing).  This increased aileron 
drag, which is called adverse yaw, tends to yaw the airplane towards the rising wing, or opposite 
to the desired direction of turn, while the banking action is taking effect.  To counteract the 
yawing tendency, rudder pressure must be applied simultaneously in the desired direction of 
turn.  This produces a coordinated turn. 
 
After the bank has been established in a theoretically perfect turn in smooth air, all pressure on 
the aileron control may be relaxed.  The airplane will remain at the bank selected with no further 
tendency to yaw since there is no longer a deflection of the ailerons.  As a result, pressure may 
also be relaxed on the rudder pedals, and the rudder allowed to streamline itself with the 
direction of the air passing it.  If pressure is maintained on the rudder after the turn is established, 
the airplane will tend to skid to the outside of the turn.  If a definite effort is made to center the 
rudder rather than let it streamline itself to the turn, it is probable that some opposite rudder 
pressure will be exerted inadvertently.  This would tend to force the airplane to yaw opposite its 
original turning path.  As a result, the airplane would tend to slip to the inside of the turn.  The

ball in the turn indicator will be displaced off-center whenever the airplane is skidding or 
slipping (Figure 3-4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3-4  Coordinated vs. Uncoordinated Turns 
 
In all turns in which a constant altitude is to be maintained, it is necessary to increase the angle 
of attack by applying back elevator pressure.  This is required because the lift produced to equal 
the weight of the airplane and the centrifugal force caused by the turn must be obtained from the 
wing to maintain altitude.  The force of lift must be further increased as the turn becomes steeper 
and the centrifugal force builds up, but must be slowly decreased as the airplane is being rolled 
back to level flight when completing the turn. 
 
To stop the turn, the wings must be returned to laterally level flight by the use of the ailerons, 
and the resulting adverse yaw (now acting in the same direction as the turn), must be overcome 
by the coordinated application of rudder.  The yaw effect will often be more apparent when 
rolling out of a turn than rolling into a turn, due to the higher angle of attack and wing loading 
which exists when the rollout is started. 
 
To understand the relationship between airspeed, bank, and radius of turn, it must be recalled that 
the rate of turn at any given airspeed depends on the amount of sideward force causing the turn; 
that is, the horizontal component.  The horizontal lift component varies in proportion to the 
amount of bank.  Thus, the rate of turn at a given airspeed increases as the angle of bank is 
increased.  On the other hand, when a turn is made at a higher airspeed for a given bank angle, 
the centrifugal force created by the turn becomes greater, causing the turning rate to become  
 
 

--- PAGE 56 ---
CHAPTER THREE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
3-12    FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
slower with an increase in radius of turn.  It can be seen, then, that at a given angle of bank, a 
higher airspeed will make the radius of the turn larger because the airplane will be turning at a 
slower rate.  
 
The inherent positive stability of the T-6B wing has an effect on the manner in which it turns.  
Turns in the T-6B may be divided into three types: shallow, moderate, and steep.  Briefly, if a 
shallow angle of bank turn is established and the controls released, the aircraft tends to return to 
level flight.  This may not always occur, because friction in the control surface rigging may 
cause a very slight control deflection.  In a moderately banked turn, if the aileron and rudder 
pressures are released, the aircraft will tend to stay at the established angle of bank.  In a steep 
angle of bank turn, the aircraft will tend to increase its bank.  The actual amount of angle of bank 
for each type is undefined and varies with changes in airspeed and configuration. 
 
The pilot’s posture while seated in the airplane is very important in all maneuvers, particularly 
during turns as it affects the alignment of outside visual references.  At the beginning the student 
may lean to the side when rolling into the turn in an attempt to remain upright in relation to the 
ground rather than “ride” with the airplane.  This tendency must be corrected at the outset if the 
student is to learn to properly use visual references. 
 
As in all maneuvering, the pilot should form the habit of ensuring that the area towards which a 
turn is to be made is clear of other aircraft.  If nearby aircraft are not detected before lowering the 
wing, it may be too late to avoid a collision.  
 
As soon as the airplane rolls from the wings-level attitude, the nose should also start to move 
along the horizon, increasing its rate of travel proportionately as the bank is increased.  Any 
variation from this will be indicative of the particular control that is being misused.  The 
following variations provide excellent guides:  
 
1. If the nose starts to move before the bank starts, rudder is being applied too soon.  
 
2. If the bank starts before the nose starts turning, or the nose moves in the opposite direction, 
the rudder is being used too late.  
 
3. If the nose moves up or down when entering a bank, excessive or insufficient back elevator 
pressure is being applied.  
 
During all turns, the ailerons and rudder are used to correct minor variations just as they are in 
straight-and-level flight.  However, during very steep turns, considerably more back elevator 
pressure and trim is required to maintain altitude than in shallow and moderate turns, and 
additional power may be needed to maintain a safe airspeed.  Frequently, there is a tendency for 
the airplane’s nose to lower, resulting in a loss of altitude.  
 
To recover from an unintentional nose-low attitude during a steep turn, the pilot should first 
reduce the angle of bank with coordinated aileron and rudder pressure.  Then back elevator 
pressure should be used to raise the airplane’s nose to the desired pitch attitude.  After  
 
 

--- PAGE 57 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER THREE 
 
FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS    3-13 
accomplishing this, the desired angle of bank can be reestablished.  Attempting to raise the nose 
first by increasing back elevator pressure will usually cause a tight descending spiral, and could 
lead to overstressing the airplane or stall. 
 
309. THE ONE-THIRD RULE 
 
Since the airplane will continue turning as long as there is any bank, the rollout must be started 
before reaching the desired heading.  The amount required to lead the heading will depend on the 
rate of turn and the rate at which the rollout will be made; however, a good rule of thumb is to 
start the rollout one-third the number of degrees of angle of bank in use.  Example:  If a 30º angle 
of bank turn was being used, the rollout would be started 10º prior to the desired heading.  As the 
wings become level, the control pressures should be gradually and smoothly released so that the 
controls are neutralized as the airplane assumes straight-and-level flight.  As the rollout is being 
completed, attention should be given to outside visual references as well as the PFD to determine 
that the wings are being leveled precisely and the turn stopped. 
 
310. SKID 
 
A skid occurs when the aircraft slides sideways away from the center of a turn.  It is caused by 
too much rudder pressure in relation to the angle of bank used.  In other words, if you try to force 
the aircraft to turn faster without increasing its degree of bank, the aircraft will skid sideways 
away from its radius of turn.  In a turn, the rudder must follow the flight path of the aircraft.  If 
excessive pressure is maintained on the rudder after the turn is established, a skid will result. 
Figure 3-5 shows a coordinated turn and a skid. 
 
A skid may also occur when you are flying in a level flight attitude if the nose of the aircraft is 
permitted to move sideways along the horizon when the wings are level.  This condition would 
occur when excessive rudder pressures are applied or when the aircraft is improperly trimmed.  
A skidded turn can develop into a dangerous situation when in close proximity to the ground.  
Essentially, what occurs is the wing on the inside of a turn is moving slower than the outside 
wing.  Since the slower wing develops less lift during a skid, this compounds the reduction in 
lift, eventually developing into a stall of one wing.  The result:  unintentional inverted flight!

Figure 3-5  Skidded vs. Coordinated Turn 
 
311. SLIP 
 
A slip occurs when the aircraft slides sideways towards the center of the turn.  It is caused by an 
insufficient amount of rudder in relation to the amount of aileron and the angle of bank used.  If 
you roll into a turn without using coordinated rudder and aileron, or if you hold rudder against 
the turn after it has been established, the aircraft will slide sideways towards its center of turn.  A 
slip may also occur in straight and level flight if one wing is allowed to drag; that is, flying with 
one wing low, while holding the nose of the aircraft straight by the use of the rudder pressure.  In 
this case, the aircraft slips downward towards the earth’s surface and loses altitude.  An 
intentional slip is not a dangerous maneuver.  The slip is an acceptable method to safely dissipate 
excess altitude under certain conditions discussed later in this manual.  Any inadvertent tendency 
to fly in an out-of-balanced flight (either a slip or skid) is NOT an acceptable practice.

Figure 3-6  Coordinated vs. Slip Turn 
 
The flight paths for a coordinated turn and a slipping turn are depicted in Figure 3-6.  During a 
turn, balanced flight is maintained by causing the aircraft to move in a curve at a rate which is in 
direct proportion to the degree of bank.  The angle of bank is established by the coordinated 
application of ailerons and rudder.  The amount of rudder required to establish a turn is 
dependent upon the rate at which the angle of bank is established.  In other words, rolling into a 
turn rapidly requires more rudder than rolling into the same turn slowly.  This interrelationship is 
absolute and should be thoroughly understood. 
 
The overlapping function of the controls provides a safety factor in the control of the aircraft.  It 
is quite possible to fly the plane without the use of one or more controls.  For example, suppose 
that the elevators failed to operate properly.  It is possible to control the position of the nose by 
the use of power.  As the power is increased, the nose will rise; as the power is decreased, the 
nose will drop. 
 
It is also possible to bank the airplane and to turn it without the use of the ailerons.  Using only 
the rudder, the plane can be turned in any desired direction.  This use of the rudder will cause the 
aircraft to yaw or skid in the direction in which the rudder is applied.  During the yawing motion, 
the outside wing moves faster through the air than the inside wing.  This increases the lift of the 
outside wing, causing it to rise, thus producing a bank in the direction in which the rudder is 
applied.  A turn can also be accomplished by using only the ailerons.  In this instance, the aircraft 
will have a tendency to slip before it begins to turn.

CHAPTER THREE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
3-16    FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
The foregoing discussion was given to show the advantage of the overlapping functions of the 
controls.  It must be emphasized, however, that smooth and balanced flight can only be achieved 
through the proper coordination of all controls.  You can also make it easy on yourself by 
trimming the aircraft. 
 
312. WIND EFFECTS AND CRAB CORRECTIONS 
 
Inasmuch as an aircraft flies in an air mass, any movement of this air mass affects the course of 
the aircraft.  In other words, the path of the aircraft over the ground will be determined not only 
by the direction in which it is headed, but also by the direction and velocity of the air mass 
movement.  In perfectly still air, for example, the nose of the aircraft points exactly in the same 
direction as its path over the ground or, to put it another way, the path of the aircraft through the 
air and its path over the ground coincide.  However, you will notice the aircraft does not always 
follow a course over the ground in the same direction the nose is pointed. 
 
You have been or will be, at one time or another, flying parallel to a road or section line.  The 
longitudinal axis of the aircraft is aligned perfectly with this road or section line and you are 
flying a straight and level course.  Suddenly, you realize that the aircraft is getting closer to the 
road or has actually crossed it, without any turn having been made.  This would indicate to you 
that the air in which you are flying is moving in a direction which has caused the aircraft to cross 
the road at some angle. 
 
Suppose you were flying along straight and level and the wind was blowing 30 knots from a 
direction 90º to your left.  At the end of one hour, the body of air in which you were flying would 
have moved 30 miles to your right.  Since the aircraft was in the body of air, and moving with it, 
you and the aircraft would also have drifted 30 miles to your right in one hour.  Of course, in 
relation to the air mass itself, you would have moved forward only, but in relation to the ground, 
you would have moved forward and 30 miles sideways.  This effect of the movement of the air 
on the track of the aircraft is known as drift.  The difference between the actual heading of the 
aircraft and its track over the ground is called the angle of drift.  Drift must be compensated for, 
in order to cause the aircraft to maintain a desired track over the ground.  The proper way to 
correct the drift when you are flying in straight and level flight and wish to follow a desired 
ground track, is to make a shallow balanced turn into the wind.  When you seem to have the 
drifting effect neutralized or stopped, return to straight and level flight.  The aircraft is now 
pointed into the wind slightly.  This causes the aircraft to fly into the wind at the rate that the 
wind is trying to move it sideways.  Since the effect of drift has now been neutralized, the 
aircraft will fly a straight and selected ground track.  The nose of the aircraft, however, is not 
pointed in the direction of the ground track.  This is known as drift correction, and is usually 
referred to as "crabbing" because the aircraft is moving sideways in relation to the ground  
(Figure 3-7).

Figure 3-7  "Crabbing" Flight Path 
 
313. CLIMBING FLIGHT 
 
For an automobile to go uphill at the same speed as that being maintained on a level road, the 
driver must "step on the gas"; that is, power must be increased.  This is because it takes more 
work to pull the car’s weight up the hill and to maintain the same speed at which the car was 
moving along the level road.  If the driver did not increase the power, the automobile might still 
climb up the incline, but it would gradually slow down to a speed slower than that at which it 
was moving on the level road. 
 
Similarly, an airplane can climb at the cruise power setting with a sacrifice of speed, or it can, 
within certain limits, climb with added power and no sacrifice in speed.  Thus, there is a definite 
relationship between power, attitude, and airspeed. 
 
When transitioning from level flight to a climb, the forces acting on the airplane go through 
definite changes.  After the addition of power, an increase in lift occurs when back pressure is 
applied to the elevator control.  This initial change is a result of the increase in the angle of 
attack, which occurs when the airplane’s pitch attitude is being raised.  This results in a climbing 
attitude.  When the inclined flight path and the climb speed are established, the angle of attack 
and the corresponding lift again stabilize. 
 
 

--- PAGE 62 ---
CHAPTER THREE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
3-18    FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS 
As the airspeed decreases to the climb speed, the downward force of the air striking the 
horizontal stabilizer becomes less, creating a longitudinally unbalanced condition that produces a 
tendency for the airplane to nose down.  To overcome this tendency and maintain a constant 
climb attitude, additional back pressure must be applied to the elevator control. 
 
The primary factor which affects an airplane’s ability to climb is the amount of excess power 
available; that is, the power available above that which is required for straight-and-level flight. 
 
During the climb, lift will increase with the flight path, so that it is not directly opposing gravity 
to support the airplane’s weight.  With the flight path inclined, the lift is partially acting 
rearward. 
 
This adverse or retarding lift is termed induced drag.  This adds to the total drag.  Since weight is 
always acting perpendicular to the earth’s surface and drag is acting in a direction opposite to the 
airplane’s flight path during a climb, it is necessary for thrust to offset both drag and gravity. 
 
As the aircraft continues to climb at a constant angle of attack, torque will drop off as air density 
decreases.  The volume of air entering the induction system gradually decreases, resulting in a 
pressure reduction within the combustion chamber.  Consequently, power decreases.  The PCL 
must be continually advanced to maintain constant power. 
 
314. CLIMBING TURNS 
 
In developing skills to perform climbing turns, the following factors should be considered: 
 
1. With a constant power setting, the same pitch attitude and airspeed cannot be maintained in 
a bank as in a straight climb, due to the decrease in effective lift during a turn. 
 
2. The degree of bank should be neither too steep nor too shallow.  Too steep a bank 
intensifies the effect mentioned above.  If too shallow, the angle of bank may be difficult to 
maintain because of the inherent stability of the airplane. 
 
3. A constant airspeed, a constant rate of turn, and a constant angle of bank must be stressed. 
The coordination of all controls is likewise a primary factor to be stressed and developed. 
 
4. The airplane will have a greater tendency towards nose-heaviness than in normal straight 
climb, due to the decrease in effective lift that is the case in all turns. 
 
5. As in all maneuvers, attention should be diverted from the airplane’s nose and divided 
among all references equally. 
 
All of the factors that affect the airplane during level (constant altitude) turns will affect it during 
climbing turns or any other turning maneuver.  It will be noted that because of the low airspeed, 
aileron drag (adverse yaw) will have a more prominent effect than it did in straight-and-level 
flight and more rudder pressure will have to be blended with aileron pressure to keep the airplane 
in coordinated flight during changes in bank angle.  Additional elevator deflection and trim will 
also have to be used to compensate for centrifugal force and loss of vertical lift, and to keep the 
pitch attitude constant. 
 

--- PAGE 63 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER THREE 
 
FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT CONCEPTS    3-19 
During climbing turns, the loss of vertical lift becomes greater as the angle of bank is increased, 
so shallow turns must be used to maintain a sufficient rate of climb.  If a medium or steep banked 
turn is used, the airplane will not climb sufficiently. 
 
315. DESCENDING FLIGHT 
 
When the power is reduced during straight and level flight, the thrust needed to balance the 
airplane’s drag is no longer adequate.  Due to the unbalanced condition, the drag causes a 
momentary reduction in airspeed.  This decrease in speed, in turn, results in a corresponding 
decrease in the wing’s lift.  The weight of the airplane now exceeds the force of lift so the 
resulting flight path is downward, with the force of gravity providing a portion of the forward 
thrust.  In effect, the airplane is actually going "downhill." 
 
As in entering a climb, the forces acting on an airplane again go through definite changes when 
transitioning from level cruising flight to a descent.  When forward pressure is applied to the 
elevator control or the airplane’s pitch attitude is allowed to lower, the wing’s angle of attack is 
decreased, the lift is reduced, and the flight path starts downward.  The initial reduction of the 
lift, which starts the airplane downward, is momentary.  When the flight path stabilizes, the angle 
of attack and lift stabilize. 
 
316. THE P.A.T. PRINCIPLE 
 
For corrections and to execute many maneuvers you must:  
 
1. Set/reset power 
 
2. Adjust the nose attitude 
 
3. Trim for the new attitude 
 
The mechanics of the transitions will be performed in a specific sequence:  
 
1. P ower 
 
2. A ttitude 
 
3. T rim 
 
Although power and attitude change are almost simultaneous, lead with PCL movement.  For 
example, consider the transition to an enroute descent.  Reduce power from normal cruise to the 
descent power setting, scanning the nose attitude.  As the power is retarded, lower the nose 
towards a descending attitude.  Finally, trim the aircraft.

The power may not be exactly the descent power setting, since it 
was initially reduced using peripheral vision.  Power is then reset 
to exactly the descent power setting after completing P.A.T. 
Remember - Power, Attitude, Trim; reset Power, reset Attitude, 
reset Trim. 
 
317. ASSUMING CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT 
 
A most important flying safety requirement is a clear, positive understanding at all times of who 
has control of the aircraft.  You must understand the procedures involved in transferring control 
of an aircraft. 
 
The instructor will tell you over the intercommunications system (ICS), “I have the controls.”  
When your instructor says, “I have the controls,” you acknowledge by stating over the ICS, “You 
have the controls.”  You then take your hands and feet off the controls.  Your instructor will then 
confirm control by saying, “I have the controls.”  Conversely, but in the same manner, when 
your instructor wants you to fly, he/she will say, “You have the controls,” whereupon you will 
take control and acknowledge over the ICS, “I have the controls.”  The instructor will then 
complete the exchange with another, “You have the controls.”  Keep flying the aircraft until you 
are told to do otherwise.  Understand that unless you and the instructor complete the 3-way 
exchange of controls, no exchange of control was made.  For example, your instructor may coach 
or aid your flare during a landing.  You may feel a presence on the control stick, but you are still 
flying and should continue to do so.  Never be in doubt as to who is flying; if you are not 
absolutely sure, safety dictates you speak up and ask!

GROUND PROCEDURES 
 
400. INTRODUCTION 
 
This chapter discusses the basic procedures essential to the safe operation of the airplane on the 
ground prior to and after a flight.  This includes the major points of ensuring that the airplane is 
in an airworthy condition, starting and stopping the engine and taxiing the airplane to and from 
the line area and the runway. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4-1  T-6B Taxiing 
 
In the line area, there is usually considerable activity - aircraft may be operating at high power 
settings, taxiing in and out of the area, taking off and landing on nearby runways; fuel trucks and 
people may be moving about the aircraft.  Therefore, constant vigilance must be exercised while 
performing ground operations. 
 
The propeller is the most dangerous part of the airplane, since under certain light conditions it is 
difficult to see a revolving propeller.  This may give the illusion that it is not there.  As a result, 
the files of Aviation Safety Offices contain many cases that read, "Victim walked into a rotating 
propeller." 
 
While approaching the airplane, the pilot should note the presence of obstructions and articles 
such as fire extinguishers, fueling or maintenance equipment, or chocks that could be a hazard 
when taxiing the airplane.

4-2    GROUND PROCEDURES 
401. NAVAL AVIATION LOGISTICS COMMAND MAINTENANCE INFORMATION 
SYSTEM  
 
The Naval Aviation Logistics Command Maintenance Information System is the standard flight-
wide maintenance system for aviation and used for T-6B maintenance.  It is a fully integrated, 
computerized system allowing input, tracking, and monitoring in real time.  This data is 
integrated for the pilot in the Aircraft Discrepancy Book (ADB), which is a designated 
maintenance binder for each T-6B aircraft on the line and is available at aircraft issue.  
Specifying that aircraft’s maintenance actions over its last ten flights, the ADB is primarily used 
for pre-flight operations by aircrew to check the aircraft’s maintenance status.  Aircrews use an 
electronic Maintenance Action Form (MAF) to document aircraft discrepancies.  The electronic 
MAF is used to ensure an accurate record is kept of all maintenance performed on an aircraft.  
Your instructor will show you how to access this information. 
 
All discrepancies are assigned either an UP or DOWN status.  A discrepancy assigned an UP 
status does not impair the safety-of-flight or mission capability of the aircraft.  An airplane may 
be flown with outstanding (not yet corrected) UP write-ups or gripes, with no danger to the crew.  
An example of an UP gripe would be “paint peeling off leading edge of starboard wing just 
forward of the pitot tube.”  Notice the specific details used in this example.  Detailed discrepancy 
reports foster a closer working relationship between aircrew and maintenance and save both time 
and money. 
 
A discrepancy assigned a DOWN status immediately “downs” the aircraft until it is fixed.  You 
must be able to interpret an outstanding MAF and determine whether the aircraft is safe for 
flight.  Besides any uncorrected write-ups, discrepancies recorded over the past ten flights should 
be reviewed as a minimum. 
 
402. CHECKLISTS 
 
It is mandatory to use checklists to inspect, start, and ensure aircraft systems are operating 
properly.  There is no excuse for lack of checklist discipline.  Checklists ensure the 
standardization of all operating procedures pertaining to the aircraft and provide a logical, safe, 
and precise sequence to follow.   
 
The accomplishment of a safe, productive flight begins with a thorough T-6B Preflight Check 
before the crew enters the aircraft.  The varied ground checklists ensure the aircraft is properly 
prepared and ready for flight.  Always with safety in mind, remain vigilant and disciplined when 
executing the ground checklists.  The majority of your initial checklist training will take place in 
the simulators prior to your first flight.  By your first Contact flight, you are expected to conduct 
all the checklists as per the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and In-flight Guide (and/or wing 
checklist guide equivalent). 
 
The checklists will be conducted in the challenge-action-response format.  This means you report 
the challenge, accomplish the required action, and state the appropriate response.  As you check 
each item, place your hand on the item to ensure the desired position is selected.  Although never 
conducted from memory, checklists must flow efficiently and precisely.

403. B ASIC 1001 
 
1. Description.  N/A 
 
2. General.  Prior to your first flight, there are several fundamental topics that you, as a 
student aviator, must be aware of and understand if you are to obtain maximum benefit from 
your primary training.  Make your initial appearance, and each succeeding appearance before 
your instructor, a good one.  Bear in mind that military courtesy and discipline are important  
factors in your training and will continue to be so as long as you are a member of the military 
service. 
 
3. Procedures.  Discuss with the instructor all of the preflight/post-flight items listed under 
Contact in the T-6B JPPT Curriculum.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
Failure to know Preflight/Post-flight procedures. 
 
404. PREFLIGHT PLANNING/BRIEFING  
 
Prior to each flight, you will be scheduled for a brief (discussion) for that flight with your 
instructor.  The Instructor Pilot (Pilot in Command) is responsible to perform and/or delegate 
preflight planning for the flight (i.e., weight and balance, fuel planning, obtaining weather brief, 
and filing flight plan as necessary).  You will assist as directed, reporting results and noting any 
discrepancies.  In later stages of training, you will be tasked with increasing responsibilities with 
preflight planning. 
 
During the brief, the instructor will expect you to know the procedures for the maneuvers to be 
flown, along with any "discuss" items listed in the T-6B JPPT Curriculum.  With respect to 
contact flight maneuvers, to “know” is to “memorize” (step by step, though not necessarily 
verbatim) each action of the procedure. 
 
For emergency procedures, only asterisk items are required to be committed to memory, 
although you must have a thorough understanding of the remaining non- asterisk steps and the 
systems involved.  You cannot prepare for your contact flights solely with this FTI.  You 
must reference the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and other publications for emergency 
procedures (EP), systems, voice communications, and general information.  You are highly 
encouraged to ask questions during the brief. 
 
Your instructor will also brief the conduct of the flight in accordance with the briefing guide 
found on the back of the Pocket Checklist.  Again, you are encouraged to ask questions.  Do not 
go flying with an unanswered question on your mind. 
 
1. Emergency Procedures/Discussed Items 
 
The Master Curriculum Guide (MCG) lists all maneuvers and items to be discussed for each 
flight.  You should be prepared to answer in depth questions about any item listed under 

--- PAGE 68 ---
CHAPTER FOUR  PRIMARY CONTACT 
4-4    GROUND PROCEDURES 
discussion.  Ensure that you refer to any and all available resources when you are studying a 
particular item.  For example, the FTI, T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual, Aeronautical Information 
Manual (AIM) and many ground school texts all contain information germane to your studies.  
Your instructor may quiz you on each discussion/demonstration and introduction item for that 
flight.  Additionally, he/she may ask you about any maneuver previously introduced or any 
subject general in nature to the T-6B (systems, limitations, etc.).  The T-6B JPPT Curriculum 
also has a listing of all emergency procedures to be discussed for each flight.  The T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual lists these procedures. 
 
2. Headwork, Procedures, and Basic Airwork 
 
a. Headwork - The ability to understand and grasp the meaning of instructions, 
demonstrations, and explanations; the facility of remembering instructions from day 
to day, the ability to plan a series or sequence of maneuvers or actions, the ability to 
foresee and avoid possible difficulties and the ability to remain alert and spatially 
oriented. 
 
Headwork is the instructor’s evaluation of the student’s situational awareness (SA), 
and his or her ability to effectively manage the aircrew responsibilities.  An example 
of a measure of headwork is whether the student remembers to "aviate, navigate, 
communicate" in the correct order.  Another measure of headwork is whether the 
student is able to effectively communicate his or her SA.  Headwork is purely a 
subjective item, and the student should never question the instructor’s assessment of 
his or her headwork. 
 
b. Procedures - The demonstrated knowledge of the sequential steps required to perform 
the curriculum maneuvers and actions.  Procedures are simply an instructor’s 
evaluation of the SNA’s ability to recall and/or apply the correct procedures to any 
situation.  This may include emergency procedures, or such things as in-flight checks.  
It may also include compliance to course rules or squadron SOP.  Procedures is a 
fairly straightforward item.  Grades other than average are normally given only in 
exceptional cases where students are not able to recite or apply basic procedures 
correctly, or when a student demonstrates unusually high competence (strive to be in 
the latter category). 
 
c. Basic Airwork - Demonstrated mastery of the PCL and flight controls to obtain the 
desired attitude, heading, airspeed and altitude consistently through a range of 
maneuvers. 
 
3. Fuel Considerations - The T -6B is usually not fuel limited on most training sorties; 
however, regular fuel checks are still required and are an important part of each mission.  Bingo 
fuel and at least one joker fuel is briefed on every mission. 
 
a. Joker fuel is set at pre-planned transition points in the sortie.  For example, a Joker 
fuel of 750 lbs might be used to depart the working area to ensure enough fuel to 
accomplish pattern operations.  A mission may require several joker fuels. 
 

--- PAGE 69 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FOUR 
 
GROUND PROCEDURES    4-5 
b. Bingo fuel is the fuel at which recovery should be initiated to arrive at the intended 
destination with the required fuel.  On most T-6 syllabus training sorties, recovery is 
often initiated prior to reaching bingo fuel due to sortie duration limitations.  Mission 
priorities and flight conditions may change while airborne (area assignment, weather 
conditions, alternate airfield requirements, etc.)  The aircraft commander may adjust 
joker and/bingo fuels during flight to accommodate mission conditions. 
 
405. PREFLIGHT INSPECTION 
 
1. Description.  N/A 
 
2. General.  The pilot who accepts an airplane for flight is in effect the commanding officer 
of that plane and is responsible for the efficient operation and safety of the aircraft, its equipment 
and its crew.  Prior to every flight, a thorough preflight inspection must be performed. 
 
A poor preflight may easily result in an embarrassing, if not dangerous, situation.  Any pilot who 
thinks that there is a possibility that a discrepancy exists which would make the aircraft unsafe 
for flight should "down" the plane, inform maintenance of the trouble, and write a thorough and 
comprehensive description of the trouble on the Maintenance Action Form (MAF).  Each pilot, 
in signing the aircraft acceptance form ("A-Sheet") prior to the flight, acknowledges acceptance 
of the aircraft in a satisfactory, safe-for-flight condition.  He should always keep in mind that 
mistakes are sometimes made even by the most competent mechanics.  The pilot must, therefore, 
make his inspection accordingly.  Under no circumstances is a pilot required to accept an 
airplane unless it is satisfactory for flight operations in all respects. 
 
Regardless of the number of items you check on a preflight, you will forget something unless 
you follow a systematic pattern each time.  For this reason, the Preflight procedure published in 
the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual shall be used by all pilots. 
 
3. Procedures.  As you approach your aircraft, notice its position and the position of adjacent 
aircraft in relation to the yellow parking spots.  An aircraft parked too far off the spots may have 
insufficient taxi clearance.  Also note the position of fire bottles and other obstructions in relation 
to the path of your aircraft as you leave the chocks.  Although a signalman will direct you out, 
you have the final responsibility to see that the aircraft clears all obstructions. 
 
EJECTION SEAT SAFETY -“Respect the Seat.”  Think of this motto every time you get in 
and out of a T-6B or any other ejection seat airplane.  Ejection seat and canopy fracturing system 
(CFS) safety is absolutely paramount during ground operations.  If unintentionally or improperly 
fired, results could be fatal.  Take extra care to ensure you and those around you never 
compromise ejection seat safety. 
 
Upon initially opening the canopy, ensure all safety pins (ejection seat and CFS) are installed, 
per the checklist, and verbally confirm with your instructor.  Never enter or exit the airplane 
without the ejection seat safety pins installed.  With the pin(s) removed, always be conscious 
of the ejection handle.  Do not rest your hands on the ejection handle and never allow any  
 

--- PAGE 70 ---
CHAPTER FOUR  PRIMARY CONTACT 
4-6    GROUND PROCEDURES 
equipment, such as kneeboards, checklists, and approach plates to interfere with it.  Remember, 
“Respect the Seat.” 
 
You are now ready to commence the Preflight Check (which includes the Before Exterior 
Inspection and the Exterior Inspection Checks) in accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight 
Manual.  You will be expected to know nomenclature for all visible aircraft and engine 
components.  Notify the other crew member of any problem areas discovered during the preflight 
inspection and if any corrective action has been taken/initiated, if necessary. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Taking too much time  Do not rush, but by the same token, move expeditiously. 
 
b. Pushing/pulling on the trim tabs, static wicks.  Check, using only a slight amount of 
pressure. 
 
406. STRAPPING IN TO THE SEAT 
 
1. Description.  N/A  
 
2. General.  Upon completion of the preflight inspection, your instructor will show you how 
to enter the cockpit, taking care not to step on the canopy rail.  Respect the ejection seat.  The T-
6B is not a particularly simple aircraft to strap into and it is easy to forget one or more buckles or 
straps.  Be patient, but precise; there is no fast way to do it.  Reference Figure 4-2. 
 
3. Procedures.  Ensure all of the harness buckles are fastened and G-suit zippers are secure 
before entering.  A good method is to start at your feet and work up.  First plug in your G-suit, 
then fasten your leg garters and Lower Koch fittings.  Attach the main oxygen hose and 
emergency O
2 hose to your CRU-60/P (before putting on the helmet) and then reach back, grab, 
and fasten the parachute risers to the harness Upper Koch fittings.  You should now be ready 
to don the helmet and lower the visor.  Attach the oxygen mask hose to the CRU-60 and plug 
into one of the two available ICS cords.  Consult the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual for Notes, 
Cautions, and Warnings during pilot hookup. 
 
Each time you fly, your seat position should be the same.  The electric seat adjustment switch is 
located on the left console behind the PCL.  When sitting straight in the seat, line up the front 
edge of the instrument glare shield with the upper part of the instrument panel so the top of the 
PFD is just visible.  Adjust rudder pedals so you can get full forward throw of either pedal with 
the corresponding brake fully depressed without locking your knee. 
 
NOTE 
 
Take extra care to ensure no straps or buckles are entangled with 
any of the side panel switches or components before actuating the 
electronic seat adjustment to prevent inadvertent (and potentially 
very costly) damage to the ejection seat and/or cockpit side 
consoles.

GROUND PROCEDURES    4-9 
3. Procedures.  Monitor the engine start sequence.  If the power management unit (PMU) 
detects a malfunction, such as a hot or hung start, it will automatically terminate the start 
sequence.  You should always be prepared to manually abort a start if the PMU fails to do its job 
and an abort is warranted.  Complete the Engine Start and Before Taxi Checklists in accordance 
with the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual. 
 
At the completion of the Before Taxi Checklist, you will perform a brake check prior to releasing 
the lineman.  Upon receiving the “release brakes” signal from the plane captain, clear left and 
right, and smoothly release brake pressure allowing the aircraft to move forward.  When 
signaled, apply the brakes to bring the aircraft to a stop.  Then pass control of the aircraft to the 
instructor who will complete his brake check.  The instructor will then pass control of the aircraft 
back to you.  Return the lineman’s salute, releasing them for other duties. 
 
NOTE 
 
Watch the lineman while the chocks are being removed or any 
time one approaches your aircraft.  Keep both of your hands visible 
if ground crews are under the aircraft or near the flight controls. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Advancing the PCL past Start Ready. 
 
b. Failure to give thumbs-up to plane captain after good sta rt. 
 
c. Fixating on one instrument (i.e., oil pressure) thereby failing to monitor all aspects of 
the start sequence. 
 
d. Failure to ensure positive change of controls during brake checks. 
 
e. Failure to adhere to lineman’s signals. 
 
f. Adding excess power for the brake check.  
 
409. TAXIING 
 
1. Description.  Taxiing is the controlled movement of the aircraft on the ground under its 
own power. 
 
2. General.  Once the aircraft is running and all applicable checks are complete, we must 
safely taxi the aircraft from its starting point on the ramp to an active runway for takeoff.  You 
should build the habit of always taxiing with the airfield diagram at your disposal (on your 
kneeboard, etc).  Have a taxi plan and know exactly where you are going before leaving the 
chocks.  This becomes even more important later in the program as you begin to conduct training 
off-station (other than home field).  Build good habits now. 
 
 

--- PAGE 74 ---
CHAPTER FOUR  PRIMARY CONTACT 
4-10    GROUND PROCEDURES 
Taxiways have a narrow yellow line painted down the middle.  Taxi with the nose wheel on this 
line.  This ensures a safe taxi clearance from fixed objects, such as parked airplanes and 
buildings.  However, the aircrew is solely responsible for obstruction clearance.  A general rule 
of thumb is to taxi no faster than a person can walk when within the line area and no faster than a 
trot when outside the line area. 
 
3. Procedures.  Taxiing in the T-6B uses power generated by the propeller, although not 
more than idle is normally needed.  Speed is controlled with the brakes; power above idle may be 
required when initiating the taxi motion, traveling uphill, during sharp turns, etc.  Directional 
control during taxi is accomplished by using the rudder pedals to manipulate the aircraft nose 
wheel steering (NWS) system, or by use of the rudder and/or differential braking.  Keep your left 
hand on the PCL; keep your right hand on the control stick, facilitating ready access to the NWS 
button.  Keep the ailerons deflected into the wind during taxi. 
 
The Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) is the normal method to directionally control the T-6B.  NWS 
is actuated by a button on the control stick  (Figure 4-4) and verified by a green “NWS” advisory 
on the EICAS.  With NWS on, the rudder pedals control the castoring of the nose wheel up to 
12° either side of center.  For turns requiring greater than 12° of nose-wheel castor, NWS must 
be disengaged and rudder and differential braking used to turn the aircraft.

Clearing is essential to safe taxiing.  People, support equipment, fuel trucks and fire bottles are 
among some of the most common hazards.  When ready to taxi out of the line area, clear the

GROUND PROCEDURES    4-11 
taxiway, left and right, for other aircraft, fuel trucks, ground personnel, etc.  Continually scan the 
entire forward area from wingtip to wingtip.  At any time, if there is doubt about obstruction 
clearance, STOP!  Most taxi accidents are easily prevented if someone makes the right decision 
to stop and re-evaluate the situation. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Not clearing area prior to starting to taxi. 
 
b. Taxiing too fast.

3. Procedures.  The checklist will be conducted in accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight 
Manual. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Omitting items from the checklist.

The importance of the Before Takeoff Checklist as a safety factor cannot be overemphasized.  
You will occasionally hear of pilots who take off with improper trim tab settings or other 
circumstances that contribute to accidents.  This is invariably due to carelessness and haste in 
completing the checklist.

FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
 
500. INTRODUCTION 
 
This chapter discusses the basic procedures that you will practice at the beginning of your 
contact training.  These basics will form the foundation of your ability to fly the aircraft and to 
later perform advanced maneuvers.  You will learn to takeoff, fly straight and level, turn, climb 
and descend.  You will even learn to stall and spin the aircraft.  While some of these maneuvers, 
such as Straight-and-Level Flight, may seem simple, they all require strict adherence to the 
procedures contained in this chapter.  In order to successfully learn to accomplish these 
maneuvers in the small amount of time that you will be airborne, it is essential that you commit 
these procedures to memory prior to strapping into the aircraft.  If you do not know the 
procedures on the ground, you will not be able to perform them in the air.  Some procedures, 
such as the spin, require extra care and preparation due to the dynamic and possibly disorienting 
nature of the maneuver.

CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-2    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
502. OPERATIONS CHECKS 
 
Accomplish the operations check to ensure various aircraft systems are operating properly.  For 
safety considerations, complete an operations check at least once every 20-25 minutes in flight, 
with the first check being accomplished during the initial departure climb. 
 
503. ASSUMING CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT 
 
It is critical to flight safety that a pilot be at the controls of the aircraft at all times.  A 
misunderstanding between two pilots as to who is actively controlling the aircraft could become 
a causal factor in a mishap.  Therefore, you must be knowledgeable of the procedures involved in 
transferring controls.  Throughout your flying career, you will fly with many pilots of various 
experience levels and backgrounds.  To avoid miscommunication, all pilots transfer the controls 
the same way, regardless of platform. 
 
Either pilot may initiate a change in control of the aircraft.  It shall be accomplished by means of 
a positive three-way exchange using the word "controls."  
 
NOTE 
 
Do not use the words "it," "aircraft," or "command" to refer to the 
controls.  
 
For example, the instructor may initiate by telling you over the ICS, "I have the controls."  You 
will then acknowledge by saying over the ICS, "You have the controls."  You will then take your 
hands and feet off the controls and your instructor will confirm he has control by saying, "I have 
the controls." 
 
When your instructor wants you to take control, he will say, "You have the controls," whereupon 
you will take control and acknowledge by saying over the ICS, "I have the controls."  Your 
instructor will complete the three-way exchange with, "You have the controls."  
 
Stay on the controls and keep flying the aircraft until you are told to do otherwise.  Never be in 
doubt as to who is doing the flying.  Always fly as if you are flying solo unless you know that the 
instructor has control.  The important thing is that a "demand and reply" series of responses is 
used so that there is no question as to who is flying. 
 
504. COMMUNICATIONS 
 
Proper radio communication procedures are extremely important to safety when operating in 
controlled airspace or the vicinity of other aircraft.  You should read and learn the basic 
communication terminology/procedures explained in Appendix B.  These procedures will be 
used throughout your aviation career.

FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-3 
505. TAKEOFF 
 
1. Description.  Takeoff is the movement of the aircraft from its starting point on the runway 
until it leaves the ground in controlled flight.  
 
2. General.  The takeoff requires a smooth transition from ground roll to controlled flight.  
Although a relatively simple maneuver, the takeoff presents numerous potential hazards.  The 
dynamics of high engine thrust, possible directional control problems, the potential for runway 
incursions, high-speed aborts, low-altitude engine failures, to name a few, make the takeoff 
regime of flight unique in its safety challenges.  Thorough and disciplined ground operations 
help lead to a safe, uneventful takeoff.   
 
Takeoffs should always be made as nearly into the wind as practical.  The aircraft’s ground 
speed in a headwind is slower at liftoff than in a tailwind, thus reducing wear and stress on the 
landing gear.  Secondly, a shorter distance is required to develop the minimum lift necessary for 
takeoff and climb.  Aircraft depend on airspeed to fly.  A headwind provides some airspeed 
before the aircraft even begins its takeoff ground roll as the wind flows over the wings. 
 
Although the takeoff and climb process is one continuous maneuver, it is divided into three 
separate steps for purposes of explanation:  takeoff roll, rotation, and initial climb (Figure 5-2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5-2  The Takeoff Roll, Rotation, and Initial Climb 
 
The takeoff roll is the portion of the takeoff procedure during which the aircraft is accelerated 
from a standstill to an airspeed providing sufficient lift for it to become airborne. 
 
The rotation is the act of raising the nose of the aircraft to a set pitch attitude, increasing AOA 
and allowing the aircraft to become airborne in controlled flight. 
 
The initial climb is the period just after the aircraft has left the runway and is normally 
considered complete when the aircraft has reached a safe maneuvering altitude.

CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-4    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
During the takeoff an abrupt application of power will cause the aircraft to yaw sharply left 
because of the torque effects of the propeller.  Steady the yawing tendency with right rudder as 
the engine spools up and the aircraft begins rolling down the runway.  Remember, the TAD will 
not begin making rudder trim adjustments until 80 KIAS and weight off wheels.  As speed 
increases, more and more pressure will be felt on the flight controls, particularly the elevator and 
rudder.  Since the tail surfaces receive the full effect of the propeller slipstream, they become 
effective first. 
 
To rotate, apply back elevator pressure at 85 KIAS to gradually raise the nose wheel off the 
runway and establish the takeoff attitude (8º nose high).  This is referred to as “rotating.”  Allow 
the aircraft to fly itself off the ground.  Do not force the aircraft into the air with excessive back-
stick pressure as this will only result in an excessively high pitch attitude, possible stall or tail 
strike.  Coordinate right rudder as necessary with TAD adjustments during rotation.  Compensate 
for the left yaw tendency as the aircraft leaves the runway with rudder, not aileron. 
 
As you move to the initial climb phase of the takeoff, check pitch attitude at approximately 8° 
nose high and begin accelerating.  The aircraft will pick up speed rapidly after becoming 
airborne.  Once a positive climb is verified and a safe landing cannot be made on the remaining 
runway in front of you, raise the gear and flaps (as per After Takeoff Checklist and the 
procedures below).  Accelerate to 140-180 KIAS and climb. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5-3  Climb Rate 
 
NOTE 
 
More efficient climbs may be required for obstacle clearance or 
other requirements such as noise abatement or cloud avoidance.  
The T-6B best rate of climb speed is 140 KIAS and 15º nose high 
(Figure 5-3). 

--- PAGE 83 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-5 
Since power during the initial climb is fixed at maximum, airspeed must be controlled with slight 
pitch adjustments.  However, do not stare at the airspeed indicator when making these slight 
pitch changes; crosscheck airspeed to confirm the correct pitch picture in relation to the horizon 
is set. 
 
For takeoff in crosswind conditions, the aircraft will tend to weather-vane into the wind and the 
upwind wing will begin to rise even in light-to-moderate crosswinds.  This tendency can be 
controlled with rudder and aileron.  Maintain positive aileron deflection into the wind once in 
position for takeoff, and maintain this crosswind control throughout the maneuver.  Use up to 
full aileron deflection into the wind at the beginning of the takeoff roll, and relax aileron input as 
speed increases to the amount required to keep wings level at liftoff.  Use rudder as necessary to 
maintain centerline.  Realize that a left crosswind will add to the aircraft’s left yawing tendency 
due to engine torque effect, requiring even more right rudder to maintain directional control.  
Once the aircraft has safely left the runway in controlled flight, level the wings, allow the aircraft 
to crab into the wind, and check balanced ball centered. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Approaching the hold short line (approximately 200 feet prior) switch to T ower 
frequency. 
 
b. When appropriate, and in accordance with the SOP, call the tower for takeoff 
clearance.  Prior to making this call, listen carefully to avoid cutting out other 
transmissions.  Instructions to "Lineup and wait" or "Hold short" must be read back.  
Clearance for takeoff will be acknowledged with, "Call sign, cleared for takeoff."  
Upon receiving takeoff clearance, taxi into the takeoff position in accordance with 
local course rules. 
 
c. After acknowledging tower’s “Cleared for takeoff” or “Lineup and wait” call, 
visually clear final, then begin taxi to the takeoff position and initiate the Lineup 
Checklist.  Verbally note right to left or left to right crosswinds as called out by 
tower.  Verify with windsock, if available. 
 
d. When cleared for takeoff and properly aligned on the runway (nose wheel centered, 
NWS disengaged, and brakes held), increase torque to ~30% and check engine 
instruments.  Report over the ICS, “Instruments checked.”  Confirm instruments 
checked in the rear cockpit as well. 
 
e. Select a reference point.  Position the elevator neutral to slightly aft of neutral.  For 
crosswinds, position aileron as required into the prevailing winds.  To compensate for 
torque effect in zero crosswind conditions, add slight right aileron at MAX power.  
Release brakes, dropping your heels to the deck (toes off the brakes). 
 
NOTE 
 
Select a reference point on centerline and towards the end of the 
runway and beyond.  Keep the nose pointed toward this reference 
throughout ground roll and rotation to aid directional control. 

--- PAGE 84 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-6    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
f. Smoothly advance the PCL to maximum allowable power (approximately two to 
three seconds).  Anticipate the need for right rudder as the engine spools up.  
Maintain directional control. 
 
g. At 85 KIAS, smoothly apply back-stick pressure and position the nose to takeoff 
attitude (spinner on or slightly below the horizon).  Allow the aircraft to fly itself off 
the deck. 
 
NOTE 
 
If gusty winds are present, increase rotation speed by 1/2 the gust 
factor (up to 10 KIAS).  For example, if winds are reported at 10 
gust 22 (i.e., 12-knot gust factor), rotate at 91 KIAS (85 + 1/2 
(12)= 91).  This is independent of wind direction. 
 
h. When a safe landing can no longer be made, check for two positive rates of climb and 
airspeed below 150 KIAS, then raise the gear.  Check airspeed above 110 KIAS and 
raise the flaps (as per After Takeoff Checklist).  Report over the ICS, “Gear up, flaps 
up at __ knots." 
 
NOTE 
 
Retraction of flaps from the TO to the UP position is not 
recommended below 110 KIAS to preclude the aircraft from  
settling back to the runway.  However, there is no minimum to 
raise the flaps from the LDG to TO position once safely airborne. 
 
i. Check nose attitude at 8º nose high and continue acceleration, trimming as necessary.  
Approaching 180 KIAS, set the 180 knot climbing attitude  and climb out in 
accordance with local course rules or departure procedures.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to maintain directional control on takeoff r oll through improper use of rudder. 
 
b. Not assuming the takeoff attitude at approximately 85 knots. 
 
c. Not relaxing back-stick pressure as necessary to maintain takeoff attitude, hence over-
rotating. 
 
d. Pulling aircraft off the deck prematurely or over-controlling. 
 
e. Swerving or skipping on takeoff roll due to improper use of crosswind correction. 
 
f. Applying insufficient right rudder on liftoff and attempting to correct with right wing 
low.

506. CROSSWIND TAKEOFF 
 
1. Description.  N/A 
 
2. General.  The procedures for a takeoff with a crosswind are the same as for a no wind 
takeoff except aileron is held into the wind to keep the wings level.  Aileron deflection is 
necessary because the upwind wing develops more lift, causing it to fly (begin rising) before the 
downwind wing.  If the upwind wing rises, skipping may result (Figure 5-4).  Skipping is a series 
of very small bounces caused when the aircraft attempts to fly on one wing and settles back onto 
the runway.  During these bounces, the aircraft moves sideways and stress on the landing gear is 
increased.  Anticipate aileron requirement due to the crosswind and either pre-position aileron 
into the wind or apply aileron into wind as required during takeoff roll.  Use rudder to keep the 
aircraft from weather-vaning (for example, crabbing or turning into the wind).  The flight 
controls become more effective as airspeed increases, so progressively smaller control inputs are 
required to maintain aircraft control. 
 
As the airplane is taxied into takeoff position, mentally note the winds as called by tower (also 
check the windsock and other indicators) so that the presence of a crosswind may be recognized 
and anticipated.  Aileron should be held into the wind as the takeoff roll is started.  As the 
airspeed increases and the ailerons become more effective, adjust the aileron inputs to maintain 
the wings level. 
 
Firmly rotate the aircraft off the runway when flying speed is reached to avoid side-slipping and 
damage to the tires.  Once the aircraft has become airborne, initial drift correction is made by 
turning into the wind with a shallow bank, then rolling wings level to maintain runway centerline 
(crabbing).

508. STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLIGHT 
 
1. Description.  Maintain a constant altitude, airspeed and heading using the horizon as the 
primary reference. 
 
2. General.  Straight-and-level flight requires familiarity with flight instruments and visual 
cues.  To fly in level flight, consciously fix reference points on the aircraft in relation to the 
horizon, and compare or crosscheck this relationship with the flight instruments.  In addition to 
outside references, refer to the PFD to crosscheck the altimeter, and vertical speed indicator. 
 
In straight-and-level unaccelerated flight at 200 KIAS, the level flight visual pitch picture is 
approximately half-ground/half-sky with the wings equidistant from the horizon, (Figure 5-5).  
At higher airspeeds, hold the nose at a lower attitude to maintain level flight; at lower airspeeds, 
hold the nose at a higher attitude.  Straight and level flight is a balanced flight condition while 
maintaining a constant heading and altitude.

Figure 5-5  Straight and Level Flight 
 
Familiarity with the design, location and purpose of flight instrumentation speeds up the 
composite cross check and aids in detecting small deviations (while they are still small).  Good 
aircraft control is a continuous succession of minor, almost imperceptible corrections to keep the 
aircraft on the desired flight path. 
 
When straight and level, trim the aircraft in all three axes.  A trim change is necessary when 
continuous control stick or rudder pressure is required to maintain the desired attitude.  Straight-
and-level flight requires almost no pressure on the controls if the aircraft is properly trimmed and 
the air is smooth; however, when flying through turbulence, the flight attitude may change 
abruptly. 
 
A properly trimmed aircraft is trimmed for a specific airspeed.  It flies at the trimmed airspeed 
hands-off; that is, with little or no force applied to the control stick or rudders.  Changes to 
airspeed require additional trim input potentially in all three axes, but predominantly in elevator 
and rudder (pitch and yaw) trim.  For example, if the PCL is retarded to slow from 200 to 120 
KIAS in level flight, the nose of the aircraft drops to seek 200 KIAS.  Back-stick pressure is 
required to maintain level flight until nose up trim relieves the back-stick pressure.  A trimmed 
aircraft reduces pilot fatigue and allows the pilot to devote more attention to task management 
and development of situational awareness on events occurring outside the cockpit.  Large 
changes in airspeed in a short amount of time will require large changes in elevator trim and will 

--- PAGE 88 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-10    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
require running the trim or holding the trim button forward or aft.  After heavy forces are 
trimmed off, a method to fine tune the trim is to loosen the grip on the control stick and note the 
direction that the nose or wings travel.  Apply trim in the opposite direction to nose or wing 
movement (for example, if the nose drops apply aft elevator trim, if the aircraft rolls left apply 
right aileron trim). 
 
A common error in straight-and-level flight is to apply force to the control stick inadvertently 
due to the weight of the pilot’s arm.  Minimize this by resting the forearm on the thigh. 
 
a. To achieve straight flight (constant heading)  
 
i. VISUAL:  The pilot selects two or more outside visual reference points directly 
ahead of the airplane (such as fields, towns, lakes, or distant clouds, to form 
points along an imaginary line) and keeps the airplane’s nose headed along that 
line.  Roads and section lines on the ground also offer excellent references.  
Straight flight can be maintained by flying parallel or perpendicular to them.  
 
Straight flight (constant wings level attitude) may also be accomplished by 
visually checking the relationship of the airplane’s wingtips with the horizon.  
Both wingtips should be equidistant below the horizon, and any necessary 
adjustments should be made with the ailerons, noting the relationship of control 
pressure and the airplane’s attitude.  
 
ii. INSTRUMENT:  An occasional check of the heading indicator should be made 
to determine that the airplane is actually maintaining flight in a constant 
direction.  
 
iii. CORRECTIONS:  Whenever an error in heading is noted, first stop the error 
and stabilize, then correct back to proper heading.  As a rule of thumb, the angle 
of bank used for heading corrections should not exceed the number of degrees 
you want to turn.  Lead the rollout on heading by the "one-third rule" (by the 
number of degrees equal to one-third the angle of bank).  This lead in rollout 
will preclude turning beyond the desired heading.  
 
Continually observing the wingtips has advantages other than being a positive 
check for leveling the wings.  It also helps divert the pilot’s attention from the 
airplane’s nose, prevents a fixed stare, and automatically expands the radius of 
visual scanning.  In straight-and-level flight, the wingtips can be used for both 
estimating the airplane’s angle of bank, and to a lesser degree, its pitch attitude.  
 
In balanced flight, any time the wings are banked, the airplane will turn.  Thus, 
close attention should be given to the wing position and attitude indicator to 
detect small indications of bank, and to the heading indicator to note any change 
of direction. 
 
 

--- PAGE 89 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-11 
When the wings are approximately level, straight flight can be maintained by 
simply exerting the necessary forces on the rudder in the desired direction.  
However, the practice of using rudder alone is not a "normal" method of aircraft 
control and may make precise control of the airplane difficult. 
 
Straight-and-level flight requires almost no application of control pressure if the 
airplane is properly trimmed and the air is smooth.  For that reason, the pilot 
must not form the habit of moving the controls unnecessarily. 
 
When practicing this fundamental flight maneuver, the pilot should trim the 
airplane so it will fly straight and level without assistance.  By using the trim 
tabs to relieve all control pressures, the pilot will find that it is much easier to 
hold a given altitude and heading.  The airplane should be trimmed by first 
applying control pressure to establish the desired attitude, and then adjusting the 
trim so that the airplane will maintain that attitude without control pressure. 
 
b. Corrections In Straight-And-Level Flight 
 
There are several methods for correcting a deviation from desired altitude/airspeed 
when maintaining level flight.  These consist of a power correction, or a power and 
attitude correction with a continual need for re-trimming.  
 
i. Off airspeed/on altitude.  If you note that the altitude is being maintained, but 
the airspeed is slow or fast, a power adjustment is necessary, since power 
controls airspeed in level flight.  Remember each torque setting given in this 
manual is a suggested starting point.  Once the appropriate power setting has 
been changed, a change in the pitch may be required to maintain the attitude for 
level flight and, as always, re-trim.  
 
ii. Off airspeed/off altitude.  If you have a high airspeed and a loss of altitude or a 
low airspeed and a gain in altitude, it is the result of not maintaining the proper 
nose attitude.  Stop the loss or gain by resetting the level flight attitude, then 
correct by trading the excess altitude or airspeed to return to the desired altitude 
and airspeed.  Re-trim. 
 
iii. On airspeed/off altitude.  If you note that you are 100 feet high, yet the 
airspeed is correct, correct to altitude by reducing the power slightly and allow 
the nose attitude to lower just slightly so the aircraft will descend back to the 
desired altitude.  Once returned to altitude, reset normal cruise power setting 
and re-trim. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Maintain balanced flight.  Trim. 
 
b. Set the nose position for straight and level by visually bisecting the windscreen with 
the horizon.  Crosscheck the altimeter and VSI.  Trim.

c. Set the wing position for straight and level flight by setting the wingtips equidistant 
below the horizon.  Crosscheck the heading.  Trim. 
 
d. Continue a working scan and if an error is recognized, make proper corrections. 
 
e. If an error in altitude is noted on the altimeter, stop the error by adjusting the nose 
attitude.  Then, using coordinated power and stick pressure, adjust back to desired 
altitude.  Re-trim. 
 
f. If an error is noted in heading, stop the drift by leveling the wings.  Turn back 
towards the desired heading, never using a greater angle of bank than the number of 
degrees off heading.  Re-trim. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Over-controlling:  Making control movements too great for the amount of correction 
necessary. 
 
b. Not recognizing a wing low or nose attitude too high or too low. 
 
c. Fixating.  Not maintaining a good scan. 
 
d. Not re-trimming. 
 
509. BASIC TRANSITIONS 
 
1. Description.  Basic transitions are used to initiate and/or level off from a climb or descent.  
The following are the four basic transitions: climb-to-cruise, cruise-to-climb, cruise-to-descent, 
and descent-to-cruise.  
 
2. General.  Use the P.A.T. principle to make all transitions.  Because trim is so vital to this 
section, now would be a good time to review the Trim Requirements discussion in Chapter two. 
 
When not in radar contact, clearing turns are mandatory for climbs and descents greater than 
1000 feet.   
 
NOTE 
 
A method for clearing turns is to use 15º of bank for 30º of turn 
either side of present heading or, if directed, the instructor 
provided heading.  Don’t focus on flying perfect clearing turns at 
the expense of actually clearing traffic around you. 
 
Your cockpit references will vary by the type of transition.  During climbs and descents, the 
airspeed indicator becomes the nose attitude crosscheck instrument.  The heading indicator 
remains the crosscheck for wings level (constant heading).  When leveling off from a climb or 

--- PAGE 91 ---

descent, the altimeter and vertical speed indicator become the nose attitude crosscheck 
instruments. 
 
510. PROCEDURES 
 
1. Cruise-to-Climb Transition: 
 
a. Power - smoothly advance power to MAX. 
 
b. Attitude - raise the nose to 12-15º nose high (nose attitude slightly above the 180-knot 
climbing attitude shown in Figure 5-6).   
 
c. Trim as required and commence clearing turns as appropriate. 
 
d. As airspeed decreases to 180 KIAS, lower nose slightly to the normal climbing 
attitude, 8º nose high (Figure 5-6). 
 
e. Re-trim as necessary to remove all pressures from the flight controls and check 
balance ball centered.

2. Climb-to-Cruise Transition: 
 
a. 200 feet prior to level-off altitude, begin lowering nose toward the level flight 
attitude.  
 
b. Trim for acceleration.

c. Five knots prior to desired cruise airspeed: 
 
Power – smoothly reduce to normal cruise, 54% (fast cruise, 80%). 
 
Attitude – set level flight picture. 
 
Trim as necessary to remove all pressures from the flight controls and check the 
balance ball centered (coordinated flight). 
 
NOTE 
 
As described in the following procedures, climbs greater than 1000 
feet are accomplished at the normal 180 KIAS, accompanied by 
clearing turns.  Climbs of 1000 feet or less will be done at MAX 
power and cruise airspeed (200 or 240 KIAS) without clearing 
turns.  In order to maintain airspeed, cruise airspeed climbs 
necessitate milder pitch changes than described in the procedures 
below. 
 
3. Cruise-to-Descent Transition: 
 
a. Power – smoothly reduce to 20%. 
 
b. Attitude – lower nose to the en route descent nose attitude (~5º Nose Low). 
 
c. Trim for power reduction and commence clearing turns as appropriate. 
 
d. Re-trim as necessary to remove all pressures from the flight controls and check the 
balance ball centered. 
 
4. Descent-to-Cruise Transition: 
 
a. Passing 100 feet prior to level-off altitude, simultaneously: 
 
Power – advance to normal cruise ~54% (fast cruise, 80%). 
 
Attitude – raise the nose to level flight picture. 
 
Trim for power addition.   
 
b. Re-trim as necessary to remove all pressures from the flight controls and check the 
balance ball centered.

check torque at MAX allowable, readjust the nose and re-trim. 
 
iv. Not performing clearing turns (when required). 
 
b. Climb-to-Cruise Transition: 
 
i. Lowering the nose to the level flight attitude immediately instead of 
TOWARDS the level flight attitude.  Remember, the airspeed is still slow. 
 
ii. Not trimming during the transition. 
 
c. Cruise-to-Descent Transition: 
 
i. Rushing the maneuver. 
 
ii. Not trimming properly. 
 
iii. Not performing clearing turns (when required). 
 
iv. Not setting/holding sufficient nose down, thereby getting slow. 
 
d. Descent-to-Cruise Transition: 
 
i. Moving nose first.  Remember P.A.T. 
 
ii. Under-trimming the nose and continuing in a descent. 
 
511. CONSTANT ANGLE OF BANK TURNS 
 
1. Description.  Turn the aircraft using a constant angle of bank to an assigned heading while 
maintaining altitude and airspeed. 
 
2. General.  When you perform constant angle of bank turns (CABT), your instructor will 
state the desired angle of bank and rollout heading.  Before commencing any turn, look in the 
direction of the turn to ascertain that the area is clear of clouds and other aircraft.  If clear, 
commence the turn.  Throughout this maneuver, a rapid and consistent scan pattern is a 
necessity. 
 
During the turn, continue to check the area clear, check the aircraft attitude with the horizon, 
then crosscheck the PFD for nose attitude with the altimeter and VSI and the angle of bank with 
the attitude indicator.  Correct the visual attitude as necessary, while periodically cross-checking 
the heading indicator for turn progress and the airspeed for power required. 

--- PAGE 94 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-16    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
To prevent turning beyond the desired heading, it is necessary to anticipate or lead this new 
heading by using the one-third rule.  This rule will be used during all turns to specified headings. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Clear the area. 
 
b. Roll into an estimated angle of bank on the horizon; add slight rudder in direction of 
turn to maintain a centered ball, then crosscheck that angle of bank on the attitude 
gyro throughout the turn. 
 
c. Adjust power and nose attitude as necessary and re- trim for the correct altitude and 
airspeed, (P.A.T.). 
 
d. Roll out of the turn on the desired heading by leading the turn with the one-third rule. 
 
e. Reset straight and level and re-trim. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Inattention to performance, (i.e., maintaining altitude but not adding any power to 
maintain airspeed).  Power + Attitude = Performance  
 
b. Not maintaining a constant angle of bank. 
 
c. Losing altitude in steep turns. 
 
d. Lack of trim. 
 
e. Not clearing the area prior to and during the turn. 
 
512. TURN PATTERN 
 
1. Description.  The turn pattern (TP) is a series of constant angle of bank turns while 
maintaining altitude and airspeed. 
 
2. General.  The TP is started in normal or slow cruise on any numbered heading.  The TP 
consists of two 30º angle of bank turns in opposite directions for 90º of heading change, two 45º 
angle of bank turns in opposite directions for 180º of heading change, and two 60º angle of bank 
turns in opposite directions for 360º of heading change.  A smooth reversal is made going from 
one turn into another, eliminating a straight and level leg (Figure 5-8).  Your IP may adjust the 
TP as needed to remain within the working airspace. 
 
During the turns, continue to check the area clear.  Check the aircraft attitude with the horizon, 
then crosscheck the PFD for nose attitude with the altimeter and VSI and the angle of bank with 
the attitude indicator.  Correct the visual attitude as necessary, while periodically cross-checking 
the heading indicator for turn progress and the airspeed for power required. 

--- PAGE 95 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-17 
The 30º angle of bank turns will require little back-stick pressure or additional power.  For the 
45º and 60º angle of bank turns, it will be necessary to raise the nose slightly to increase the 
angle of attack in order to compensate for the loss of vertical lift as the bank steepens.  
Additional power will be required to maintain airspeed.  To avoid overshooting the rollout 
headings, lead the rollout heading by a number of degrees equal to one-third the angle of bank 
(for a 30º angle of bank turn, lead the rollout by 10º).  Strive for smooth reversals between turns. 
 
Trim the aircraft as necessary throughout the pattern.  Remember, as the reversal or rollout 
occurs, the nose must be lowered back to the level attitude, and since it has been trimmed "up" 
during the turn, the nose will require forward stick pressure to lower it.  Remember to use the 
P.A.T. principle.

b. Clear the area.  Turn either direction for 90º of heading change using a 30º angle of 
bank.  Clear the area (in the other direction), then reverse the turn, leading by the one-

c. Clear the area.  Reverse the turn leading by the one-third rule and turn for 180º of 
heading change using a 45º angle of bank.  Maintain altitude and airspeed with power 
and nose attitude; trim.  Clear the area (other direction), then reverse the turn using 
the one-third rule for 180º of heading change using a 45º angle of bank.  Remember

to adjust nose attitude as necessary to maintain airspeed and altitude while rolling 
through wings level. 
 
d. Clear the area.  Reverse the turn leading by the one-third rule and turn for 360º of 
heading change using a 60º angle of bank.  Adjust power and nose attitude to 
maintain altitude and airspeed; trim.  Clear the area (other direction), then reverse the 
turn leading by the one-third rule.  Hold slight forward stick pressure to prevent  
 ballooning as you roll through the wings level.  Reestablish t he attitude to maintain 
altitude; turn for 360º of heading change using a 60º angle of bank.  
 
e. Roll out on the original heading using the one-third rule and holding slight forward    
stick pressure to prevent ballooning. 
 
f. Reset power to the normal cruise power setting (as required), reset attitude and re-
trim for straight and level flight.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Applying the control pressures too rapidly and abruptly, or using too much back- stick 
pressure before it is actually needed.  Remember the aircraft is flown through a 
medium-banked turn before it reaches a steeper turn.  
 
b. Not holding the nose attitude steady.  In order to determine the appropriate 
corrections, you must first establish a steady attitude and allow the instruments to 
stabilize.  
 
c. Staring at the nose and consequently applying control corrections too late.  Divide 
your attention.  Scan your instruments, never fixating on any one instrument.  
Anticipate the need for additional power and nose up.  Do not wait until you are low 
or slow.  
 
d. Gaining altitude in reversals.  Not lowering nose as the wings pass the level flight 
attitude, usually due to fixating on the PFD instead of scanning the horizon. 
 
e. Not clearing the area before and during all turns.  
 
f. Not flying in balanced flight. 
 
513. LEVEL SPEED CHANGE 
 
1. Description.  Level speed changes (LSC) are taught to familiarize you with the various 
trim adjustments required with changes in airspeed, power setting, and aircraft configuration.  
 
2. General.  The LSC maneuver will be commenced on any assigned heading.  The sequence 
is flown from normal cruise (200 KIAS) to the downwind configuration (120 KIAS), to the 
landing flap approach configuration (110 KIAS), and then to normal cruise (200 KIAS).  

--- PAGE 97 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-19 
Because of the numerous tasks associated with these transitions, a good outside visual scan 
pattern cannot be overemphasized.  You will experience changes in aircraft attitudes and control 
pressures during each transition.  Your instructor will require you to fly the aircraft at various 
angles of bank in the downwind and landing approach configurations to experience the way in 
which the aircraft handles at these slower airspeeds.  During these turns, additional power must 
be applied to maintain airspeed with attitude adjustment to maintain altitude.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Establish the aircraft in the normal cruise configuration (200 KIAS) on any numbered 
heading.  
 
b. Reduce power to idle.  Trim for deceleration.  When airspeed is below 150 KIAS, 
lower the landing gear and start the Before Landing Checklist over the ICS. 
 
c. As the airspeed approaches 120 KIAS, adjust power to ~31% to maintain 120 KIAS.  
 
d. Stabilize aircraft in the downwind configuration.  Trim off control pressures. 
 
NOTE 
 
Your instructor may want you to practice a few shallow turns in 
this configuration prior to continuing.  Remember, you will see this 
nose attitude on the downwind leg when you begin practicing the 
landing pattern. 
 
e. Lower Landing flaps.  As airspeed approaches 110 KIAS, advance power to ~ 50% 
and stabilize in the landing flap approach configuration.  Trim. 
 
f. Complete the Before Landing Checklist over the ICS, “Gear down, flaps landing,   
speed-brake retracted, checklist complete.” 
 
g. Advance power to maximum, check airspeed below 150 KIAS, and raise the gear and 
flaps.  Trim for acceleration. 
 
h. Accelerate to normal cruise.  As airspeed approaches 200 KIAS, reduce power to  
~54%. 
 
i. Re-trim as necessary to remove all pressures from the flight controls and check the 
balance ball centered. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to properly trim rudder pressures, resulting in poor heading control. 
 
b. Commencing the Landing Checklist in the middle of a transition, resulting in poor 
basic airwork.  

--- PAGE 98 ---

5-20    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
c. Failure to maintain proper nose attitudes associated with configuration. 
 
d. Failure to properly trim elevator pressure, resulting in poor altitude control. 
 
514. STALLS 
 
1. Description.  Stalls are taught to develop your ability to recognize a complete stall or an 
approaching stall and to recover correctly with a minimum loss of altitude. 
 
2. General.  You will learn to recognize the approaching stall or complete stall through a 
combination of the senses of sight, sound and feel. 
 
a. Vision is useful in detecting a stall condition by noting the attitude of the airplane.  
This sense can be fully relied on only when the stall is the result of an unusual 
attitude of the airplane.  However, since the airplane can also be stalled from a normal 
attitude, vision in this instance would be of little help in detecting the approaching 
stall. 
 
b. Hearing is also helpful in sensing a stall condition, since the tone level and intensity 
of sounds incident to flight decrease as the airspeed decreases.  The reduction of the 
noise made by the air flowing along the canopy as airspeed decreases is also quite 
noticeable, and when the stall is almost complete, vibration and its incident noises 
often increase greatly. 
 
c. Kinesthesia, or the sensing of change in direction or speed of motion, is probably the 
most important and the best indicator to the trained and experienced pilot.  If this 
sensitivity is properly developed, it will warn of a decrease in speed or the beginning 
of a settling or "mushing" of the airplane. 
 
d. The feeling of control pressures is also very important.  As speed is reduced, the 
"live" resistance to pressures on the controls becomes progressively less.  Aircraft 
response to control movements also decreases until a complete stall when all controls 
can be moved with almost no resistance, and with little immediate effect on the 
airplane.  The Stick shaker will normally occur 5-10 knots prior to the stall, with 
airframe buffet occurring almost immediately thereafter.  The stick shaker may 
sometimes mask airframe buffet making it difficult to feel.  In some circumstances, 
aircraft buffet may occur before the stick shaker activates. 
 
Accomplish and/or review the THREE Cs before performing stall maneuvers.  The THREE Cs 
may be accomplished in any order and are not required between individual maneuvers if flown in 
a series. 
 
CONFIGURATION.  Put the aircraft in the appropriate configuration. 
 
CHECKLIST.  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS.  Clear the working area sufficiently (approximately a 180°) utilizing 30-

--- PAGE 99 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-21 
60° angle of bank, 45° angle of bank maximum in the landing configuration.  Normally, turning 
stalls should be performed in the same direction of the last clearing turn but can be adjusted as 
needed to remain within the working area boundaries.  Recovery from all stall maneuvers must 
be accomplished above 6000 feet AGL. 
 
Stalls will be preceded by the stick shaker or airframe buffet (whichever occurs first), at which 
point, recovery will be initiated.  However, during some training maneuvers you will practice 
full stalls (nose pitches down) before initiating recovery.  This is done, not to foster a complacent 
attitude towards stalls, but to build skill and confidence in the recovery procedures.  Obviously, 
if a stall warning (i.e., stick shaker) is encountered at any time other than during stall practice, 
you will initiate recovery immediately. 
 
3. Procedures.  Refer to procedures in this chapter. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
Not recovering at the first indication of stall. 
 
515. ENERGY MANAGEMENT 
 
1. Description.  Planning a sortie profile that allows maneuvers to be accomplished in an 
order that optimizes time and energy. 
 
2. General.  Energy level is defined by airspeed (kinetic energy) and altitude (potential 
energy) and is manipulated with power, drag, and G-loading.  Plan maneuvers in an order that 
minimize the requirement for deliberate energy changes, and make use of the inherent energy 
gaining or losing properties of individual maneuvers. 
 
a. ALTITUDE AND AIRSPEED EXCHANGE.  Potential energy (altitude) and kinetic 
energy (airspeed) can be traded.  For example, 1,000 feet of altitude equals 
approximately 50 knots of airspeed with the canopy bow on the horizon and 
maximum power. 
 
b. OPTIMUM ENERGY LEVEL.  In a typical MOA, optimum energy level for 
aerobatic maneuvering is 180 to 200 KIAS at an altitude midway between the top and 
bottom area limits.  Energy is sufficient for any aerobatic maneuver after an airspeed 
or altitude exchange to meet briefed entry parameters. 
 
c. LOSING ENERGY.  Energy may be decreased with low power settings, increased 
drag (speed brake), or increased AOA (G-loading).  A simple way to lose energy is to 
perform a constant airspeed descent until the desired energy level is reached. 
 

--- PAGE 100 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-22    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
d. GAINING ENERGY.  Energy gain is enhanced with low AOA (avoid flight near 
zero-G) and high power.  The best method to gain energy is a climb at 140 to 160 
KIAS with MAX power.  
 
e. ENERGY PLANNING.  Constant awareness of total energy state aides in correct 
maneuver selection and effective profile management, which allows a smooth flow 
between maneuvers with minimum delay. 
 
516. SLOW FLIGHT (SCATSAFE) MANEUVER 
 
1. Description.  The slow flight maneuver is designed to develop your ability to fly the 
aircraft in a near-stalled condition. 
 
2. General.  This maneuver will be demonstrated by the instructor and then flown by the 
student.  Every takeoff and landing you make requires you to operate the aircraft at low airspeed.  
During training, students are taught "flight at minimum controllable airspeed" so they may learn 
the effect that airspeed has on aircraft performance and controllability. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  At a safe altitude (complete maneuver above 6,000 feet 
AGL), slow the aircraft below 150 KIAS and configure with the landing gear down. 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Before Landing Checklist and the Pre-Stalling, 
Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist over the ICS. 
 
c. CLEARING TURN:  Sufficiently clear the working area. 
 
d. Lower landing (LDG) flaps.  Continue reducing airspeed to approximately 80 KIAS 
(15 units AOA), while setting approximately 45% torque. 
 
NOTE 
 
The stick shaker may be on throughout the demo. 
 
Demonstrate the following aircraft flight characteristics: 
 
S - Straight and Level.  During operation on the back side of the power curve, increased AOA 
results in increased drag and a stall if not carefully flown.  Note the pitch attitude, torque, and 
rudder deflection required to maintain straight-and-level flight.  This is the sight picture a pilot 
should see at rotation during takeoff or just prior to touchdown during landing. 
 
C - Coordination Exercise.  Conduct a series of left and right turns, using 15-20° bank.  Keep 
the ball centered using coordinated rudder.  Approximately two inches of right rudder is required 
to maintain straight-and-level, coordinated flight.  Right turns require approximately twice the 

--- PAGE 101 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-23 
rudder deflection to maintain coordination.  Left turns require approximately one-half inch of 
right rudder to maintain coordination. 
 
A - Adverse Yaw.  Lack of coordinated rudder during a turn results in weaving or “S-ing” on 
final.  Select two points, one directly in front of the aircraft and one approximately 20° to the 
right of the nose.  Without applying rudder, initiate a rapid right turn with 20° bank.  Note the 
initial tendency of the nose to yaw left.  After approximately 20° of turn, roll out rapidly without 
using rudder.  The nose continues past the selected roll out point then comes back.  Next, initiate 
a right turn, using coordinated rudder.  Notice that the nose immediately tracks in a coordinated 
manner.  After 20° of turn, roll out using properly coordinated rudder and note that the nose 
stops on the selected rollout point.  
 
T - Torque and Turns.  The T-6B initially tends to pitch up, yaw, and roll left if positive control 
is not maintained during full power takeoffs and landings.  To demonstrate this, quickly increase 
power to MAX from straight-and-level, coordinated slow-flight and release the controls.  The 
nose tracks up, yaws, and rolls left, and approaches a stall.  Recover from the buffet, prior to 
stall.  Reestablish slow-flight and increase power to MAX again.  This time, hold proper takeoff 
pitch and apply coordinated rudder to maintain a proper nose track.  Positive control of the 
aircraft ensures safe takeoffs, touch-and-go landings, and go-arounds. 
 
S - Steep Turns.  High angles of bank at slow airspeeds increase stall speed and cause rapid turn 
rates.  Slowly increase bank towards 60° while adding power and back pressure to maintain level 
flight.  Look at a point on the ground and watch the wingtip appear to pivot around the selected 
point.  The AOA quickly increases, progressing into a stall.  Roll out of the bank to recover from 
the impending stall. 
 
A - Abrupt Control Movement.  Fixation on the aim point during landing can cause an abrupt 
flare.  Late recognition of the rapidly approaching runway causes the pilot to abruptly raise the 
nose of the aircraft, causing an approach-to-stall condition, a hard landing, or both.  The stick 
shaker activates, but there is no decrease in sink rate.  To demonstrate this, abruptly apply back-
stick pressure to 20° nose-high to simulate snatching the control stick in the flare.  The AOA 
rapidly increases and the aircraft progresses towards a full stall.  Release backpressure to 
recover.  To avoid this condition on landing, view the total landing environment and apply 
controls in a smooth, positive manner. 
 
F - Flap Retraction.  Flap retraction prior to the recommended airspeeds causes the aircraft to 
lose lift and develop a sink rate.  From straight-and-level coordinated slow-flight, raise the flaps 
from LDG to UP without pausing at the TO position.  While retracting the flaps, increase the 
pitch attitude to maintain altitude.  Initially airspeed increases (due to reduced drag as flaps begin 
to retract), but as flaps retract towards UP, the AOA increases and a stall results.  Recover from 
the stall by selecting LDG flaps. 
 
E - Effectiveness of Controls.  Rapid control inputs, especially in the flare, often do not give the 
aircraft sufficient time to respond.  Move the ailerons with small, rapid movements.  Notice that 
even with aileron movement, there is little effect on heading or bank during slow-flight.  In slow-
flight, smooth, positive inputs are required to effectively control the aircraft as there is less 
airflow over the control surfaces at slow airspeeds.

4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Abrupt control movements. 
 
b. Failure to clear area during maneuver. 
 
c. Failure to maintain altitude. 
 
d. Failure to use adequate trim. 
 
517. POWER-ON-STALLS 
 
1. Description.  Stall the aircraft in a power-on condition to demonstrate the proper recovery 
when power is available.  
 
2. General.  Proper recognition and recovery of an aerodynamic stall with minimum loss of 
altitude.  Aircraft pitch and bank angle will held constant until control effectiveness is lost, 
indicated by uncommanded nose drop or unplanned rolling motion.  To recover, RELAX back-
stick pressure to break the stall, and select MAX power.  Simultaneously LEVEL the wings and 
center the BALL.  The maneuver is complete when the aircraft has established a positive rate of 
climb.  An entry speed of 150 KIAS results in about 1500-2000 feet altitude gain. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Establish the aircraft in the clean configuration.  Complete 
maneuver above 6,000 feet AGL. 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checks. 
 
c. CLEARING TURNS:  Sufficiently clear the working area. 
 
d. Straight-Ahead Stall.  Adjust the PCL to 30-60% torque.  Raise the nose to a pitch 
attitude between 15-40°. 
 
e. Maintain attitude using increasing back pressure.  Keep the wings level with 
coordinated rudder and aileron.  Initiate recovery when control effectiveness is lost.  
An uncommanded nose drop despite increased backpressure or an uncommanded 
rolling motion indicates loss of control effectiveness.  Do not attempt to maintain 
pitch attitude or bank angle after control effectiveness is lost.  Full back-stick may not 
occur before recovery is required.  Emphasize observation of aircraft handling 
characteristics during recovery from the stall and not the exact point where the full 
stall is reached. 
 
f. Recovery.  Simultaneously RELAX back-stick forces as necessary to break the stall, 
advance the PCL to MAX, use coordinated rudder and aileron to LEVEL the wings, 
and center the BALL.  As AOA decreases and stall is broken, positive pressure is felt 

--- PAGE 103 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER FIVE 
 
FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-25 
in the controls.  At lower pitch attitudes (between 15 and 30°), the aircraft stalls at a 
higher airspeed and regains flying airspeed faster.  At higher pitch attitudes (between 
30 and 40°), the stall speed is slower and a greater pitch reduction is necessary to 
regain flying airspeed. 
 
g. Use maximum AOA to minimize altitude loss (14-17.9 units AOA).  Avoid a 
secondary stall (indicated by upward nose track stopping despite increasing back 
pressure on the control stick).  A secondary stall is an accelerated stall that occurs 
after a partial recovery from a preceding stall.  It is caused by attempting to hasten a 
stall recovery when the aircraft has not regained sufficient flying speed.  Recovery is 
complete when the aircraft is wings level with a positive rate of climb. 
 
h. Turning Stall.  Setup is the same as the straight-ahead stall, except 20-30° of bank in 
either direction is added.  Hold the bank angle with rudder and aileron pressure until 
control effectiveness is lost.  Recovery is the same as for the straight-ahead stall. A 
precision entry is not as important as proper recognition and recovery from the stall. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to maintain a constant pitch or bank attitude prior to loss of control 
effectiveness. 
 
b. Failure to recognize loss of control effectiveness (early/late initiation of recovery). 
 
c. Failure to recognize when the stall has been broken (early/late initiation of recovery 
to level flight). 
 
d. Failure to minimize altitude loss during recovery.  Recovering with less than 14-17.9 
units AOA. 
 
e. Entering a secondary stall during the recovery. 
 
518. ELP STALLS 
 
1. Description.  Stall the aircraft in a power-off condition to demonstrate the proper recovery 
when no power is available. 
 
2. General.  ELP stalls are flown to practice recovery from potentially dangerous low 
airspeed conditions prior to high key and during the ELP.  They may be flown in one continuous 
series or as separate individual maneuvers.  Speed may decrease for various reasons including, 
inattention, task saturation, and attempts to stretch the glide to regain profile.  A full series of 
ELP stalls may take up to approximately 4000 feet. 
 
We use 4-6% torque to simulate the feathered condition while practicing this maneuver.  Best 
glide speed in the clean configuration is approximately 125 KIAS with a sink rate of 1100-1300 
feet per minute.  Pay close attention to the glide portion of this procedure before the stall.  This 
will probably be your first look at flight in the (simulated) feathered condition.  Note the nose

attitude and flight characteristics of the airplane when flying the power-off best glide speed. 
After the recovery, you will return to this attitude and airspeed to complete the maneuver. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
Glide to High Key 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Establish the aircraft in the slow cruise configuration (150 
KIAS). 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checks. 
 
c. CLEARING TURNS:  Sufficiently clear the working area. 
 
d. Roll wings level, reduce power to 4-6% torque and begin decelerating towards best 
glide speed, 125 KIAS. 
 
e. As airspeed approaches 125 KIAS, lower nose to the 125- knot glide attitude (horizon 
bisecting windscreen) and stabilize the glide.  Re-trim. 
 
f. Raise the pitch attitude slightly (approximately 10° nose up) and allow airspeed to 
decay until the gear warning horn sounds (120 KIAS).  Recover by lowering the pitch 
attitude slightly below the normal glide picture.  Reestablish glide at 125 KIAS.  
Altitude loss is approximately 300 feet. 
 
Glide Between High and Low Key  
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Establish the aircraft in the downwind configuration (120 
KIAS gear down, flaps as required). 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checks. 
 
c. CLEARING TURNS:  Sufficiently clear the working area. 
 
d. Roll wings level, reduce power to 4-6% torque and lower the nose to maintain 120 
KIAS. 
 
e. Simulate the turn from high key to low key by rolling into a 30° AOB turn in the last 
direction of the clearing turn.  Re-trim. 
 
f. Raise pitch attitude (approximately level-flight turn picture) and allow airspeed to 
decay until the stick shaker is activated or an approach to stall indication is noted.  
Maintain the turn or profile ground track and recover by lowering the pitch attitude to 
put the prop arc on the horizon (approximately 8° nose-low) until 120 KIAS is 
regained.  Altitude loss is approximately 800 feet.

Maintain the turn or profile ground track and recover by lowering pitch attitude to put 
the prop arc on the horizon (approximately 8° nose-low) until 120 KIAS regained.  
Altitude loss is approximately 900 feet. 
 
NOTE 
 
Due to altitude loss during the recovery, if an ELP stall between 
low key and the runway is encountered during an actual engine 
failure, consideration should be given to ejecting. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to recognize an approach to stall indication. 
 
b. Lowering the nose too far, resulting in excessive loss of altitude.  
 
519. LANDING PATTERN (APPROACH TURN) STALLS 
 
1. Description.  Proper recognition of and recovery from approach to stall conditions in the 
landing pattern.  Training emphasis is on recognition of approach-to-stall indications and 
appropriate recovery procedures, not on setup or flow from one stall to the next.  However, much 
like power-on stalls, the smoother the entry, the cleaner the stall. 
 
2. General.  In the landing pattern, unrecoverable stall or sink rate situations can occur before 
indications become obvious.  If a stall indication occurs in the landing pattern, disregard ground 
track, and recover as described below.  If in the pattern, do not hesitate to eject if recovery 
appears unlikely.  The three landing pattern stalls practiced are configured stalls, emphasizing 
final turn and final stall recovery.  Landing pattern stalls may be practiced in any flap 
configuration.

3. Procedures. 
 
Overshooting (Nose-low) Final-Turn Stall 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Establish the aircraft in the downwind configuration (120 
KIAS gear down, flaps as required). 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist and the 
Before Landing Checklist. 
 
c. CLEARING TURN:  Sufficiently clear the working area. 
 
d. Initiate a normal pattern transition by reducing power and lower flaps to desired 
configuration.  Initiate a normal final turn (~30º AOB).  After the turn is established, 
retard the PCL to idle, steadily increase bank, and back pressure to simulate a steep, 
overshooting final turn.  Do not raise the nose.  Recover on approach to stall 
indication, which is activation of the stick shaker or aircraft buffet, whichever occurs 
first. 
 
Undershooting (Nose-high) Final-Turn Stall 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Establish the aircraft in the downwind configuration (120 
KIAS gear down, flaps as required). 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist and the 
Before Landing Checklist. 
 
c. CLEARING TURN:  Sufficiently clear the working area. 
 
d. Initiate a normal pattern transition by reducing power and lower flaps to desired 
configuration.  Initiate a turn to final (~30º AOB).  After the turn is established, retard 
the PCL to idle, raise the nose slightly, and shallow out the bank to simulate an 
undershooting crosswind.  Continue turn until approach to stall indication.  Recover 
on approach to stall indication, which is activation of the stick shaker or aircraft 
buffet, whichever occurs first.  Recovery is the same as for the overshooting final-
turn stall; however, since airspeed is initially lower, recovery takes slightly longer. 
 
Landing Attitude Stall  
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Establish a simulated final approach at 5 to 10 knots above 
final approach airspeed commensurate with flap setting. 
 
b. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist and the 
Before Landing Checklist. 
 
c. CLEARING TURN:  Sufficiently clear the working area.

FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-29 
d. Retard the PCL to idle and execute a simulated landing transition.  Hold the landing 
attitude constant until an approach to stall indication occurs.  Recover on approach to 
stall indication, which is activation of the stick shaker or aircraft buffet, whichever 
occurs first.  Recovery is similar to the final turn stalls. 
 
Recovery 
 
For all Landing Pattern stalls, recover on approach to stall indication, which is activation of the 
stick shaker or aircraft buffet, whichever occurs first.  Do not enter a full stall!  The following 
procedure will be used to recover: 
 
RELAX:  Relax back-stick pressure slightly to decrease AOA and break the stall (do not 
dump the nose). 
 
MAX:  Power to maximum. 
 
LEVEL:  Level the wings to the horizon, and then establish a positive climbing attitude.  
Use 14-17.9 units AOA for maximum performance. 
 
BALL:  Apply right rudder as necessary to center the balance ball. 
 
Recovery is complete when the aircraft is wings level and safely climbing. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to hold the nose in the landing attitude, thus delaying or not obtaining a stalled 
condition (letting the nose fall through).  
 
b. Failure to maintain angle of bank during the entry.  The aircraft will have a tendency 
to continue rolling past 30º to 45° angle of bank.  In addition, with increasing angle of 
bank, the nose will have a tendency to drop.  
 
c. Releasing instead of relaxing back-stick pressure, or applying forward stick pressure 
on recovery, thus resulting in a nose low attitude and excessive altitude loss.  
 
d. Not relaxing back-stick pressure enough, causing the aircraft to remain stalled.  
 
e. Cycling rudders in an attempt to keep the ball centered before flying speed is attained.  
 
f. Delay in raising the nose to the recovery attitude to stop the altitude loss.  
 
g. Failure to add sufficient power on recovery. 
 
520. SLIP 
 
1. Description.  A slip is an out-of-balance flight condition used to increase the sink rate and 
lose excess altitude while maintaining a constant airspeed and a specific track over the ground.  

--- PAGE 108 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-30    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
2. General.  A slip occurs when the aircraft slides sideways towards the center of the turn.  It 
is caused by an insufficient amount of rudder in relation to the amount of aileron and the angle of 
bank used.  If you roll into a turn without using coordinated rudder and aileron, or if you hold 
rudder against the turn after it has been established, the aircraft will slide sideways towards the 
center of the turn.  A slip may also occur in straight-and-level flight if one wing is allowed to 
drag; that is, flying with one wing low, and holding the nose of the aircraft straight by the use of 
rudder pressure.  In this case, the aircraft slips downward towards the earth’s surface and loses 
altitude.  In a full slip, the rate of descent may be in excess of 2000 feet per minute.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Although the slip can be flown at any airspeed or configuration, it will normally be 
demonstrated and introduced at altitude simulating the slip to high key at 125 KIAS, 
clean configuration.  Slips may also be demonstrated at 120 KIAS with gear 
down/flaps as required. 
 
NOTE 
 
Caution must be exercised, since stall speed is increased in this 
out-of-balance flight condition. 
 
b. To initiate a slip from wings level, lower one wing while applying opposite (top) 
rudder pressure.  Select a reference point on the horizon and adjust rudder pressure 
and/or angle of bank to maintain the desired ground track.  Full rudder deflection is 
not required during a slip.  Use caution if electing to slip with gear down, especially 
low to the ground. 
 
c. T o initiate a slip while in a turn, lower the inboard wing while increasing opposite 
(top) rudder pressure.  It will be necessary to vary the angle of bank and rudder 
pressure to maintain the desired track over the ground.  
 
d. Monitor airspeed closely, adjust nose attitude as necessary to maintain 125 KIAS.  
Monitor the VSI and note increased rate of descent.  
 
NOTE 
 
The low-fuel warning light for the low-wing tank may illuminate 
regardless of fuel state.  
 
e. To recover from the slip, smoothly roll the wings towards level while reducing rudder 
pressure.  Remember, the slip must be taken out with enough altitude remaining to 
slow the rate of descent and ensure positive control of the aircraft during the final 
moments of any maneuver in which it is used.

4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Improper application of rudder, resulting in a skid.  
 
b. Poor airspeed control.  Remember, nose attitude still controls airspeed.  
 
c. Not varying angle of bank or rudder pressure to maintain desired track over ground.  
 
d. Rough entry and recovery control applications.  
 
521. SPIN 
 
1. Description.  Two primary factors must be present for an aircraft to spin: stalled AOA and 
yaw (rotation about the vertical axis). 
 
2. General.  Spins are taught primarily to increase your confidence in yourself and the 
aircraft and improve your orientation in unusual attitudes.  In this respect, spins are an excellent 
introduction to aerobatics.  Practice them to the left and right.  A spin is very easy to perform and 
recovery can be just as easily effected.  This maneuver places no excessive loads or stresses on 
the aircraft when properly executed. 
 
We practice spins for the same reason we practice stalls.  Stalls and spins are not normal flight 
maneuvers, but they can occur during flight and only through practice can they be recognized 
rapidly, and recovered from instinctively and reflexively by making the mechanical flight control 
inputs necessary. 
 
Spins are generally performed only for air shows and training, but in WWI spins were used to 
descend through a cloud layer safely.  With no flight instruments, early aviators who tried to fly 
through the clouds could easily get vertigo and enter a spiral with rapidly increasing airspeed that 
(when exceeding V
ne) resulted in destruction of the plane and the aviator.  A solution was to 
enter a spin, descend down through the clouds, and hope you had enough altitude and visibility 
after breaking out to recover safely.  With technology and instrumentation, this maneuver is no 
longer needed to descend through a cloud layer. 
 
An airplane’s design is a compromise between stability and maneuverability.  Modern civilian 
general aviation and transport planes are designed with stability in mind, and although not spin-
proof, are usually difficult to spin.  Very few modern trainers are certified for spins.  Military 
fighter and attack aircraft, however, are designed for maneuverability and performance.  These 
high performance planes have poor stall characteristics and can depart from controlled flight 
readily and violently during high G and high AOA maneuvering.  A departure usually begins 
with a stall and can then involve a pitch-up, nose slice, pitch-roll coupling, pitch-yaw coupling or 
some other type of post-stall gyration, resulting in a spin/out-of-control situation.  To 
successfully recover, the pilot has to immediately assess what is going on and put in the proper 
control inputs to effect recovery.  If the aircraft will not recover, the pilot needs to recognize it in 
ample time to eject safely. 
 

--- PAGE 110 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
5-32    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
For these reasons, spin training is started early in a Student Naval Aviator’s primary flight 
training.  Spins are confidence builders for a student.  They build confidence in his or her own 
ability to maintain orientation and reflexively apply proper recovery controls.  They also build 
his or her confidence in the ability of the airplane to respond to specific flight control inputs and 
regain normal flight.  Even in our relatively stable training plane, an incipient spin can develop 
with improper or heavy-handed flight control inputs during stall training or aerobatic maneuvers.  
A snap roll, such as you see in air shows, is simply a spin while flying horizontally (performed 
by abruptly pulling back-stick to stall the wing and kicking rudder in the direction of the desired 
roll).  Instructors Under Training perform fully developed spins and progressive spins to more 
fully investigate the spin characteristics of the T-6B, because they will be doing a lot of 
intentional spins (and perhaps some unintentional ones!) during their tour in the training 
command. 
 
NOTE 
 
Spins shall be practiced in the clean configuration.  In the event of 
an unintentional spin with gear and flaps down, they shall be 
retracted immediately to prevent possible damage by exceeding 
their speed limitations. 
 
a. Spin Entry.  At the stall, positive pilot action is required to effect spin entry by 
application of pro-spin controls.  At the stall, smoothly apply full rudder in direction 
of desired spin and full back-stick with neutral aileron.  The controls must be held 
fully against the stops or the maneuver may not develop into a spin, but may develop 
into a spiral with rapidly increasing airspeed. 
 
b. Spin Characteristics.  An erect spin is characterized by roll and yaw in the direction 
of applied rudder, resulting in a barrel roll maneuver to a near level attitude after 
completing the first turn.  After completing the initial turn, the nose will pitch to 
approximately 60° below the horizon, with pitch attitude becoming oscillatory.  After 
completing approximately 3 turns, the spin will have entered a near steady-state 
condition.  Spin rotation rates will stabilize to approximately 2 to 3 seconds per turn 
with altitude loss of 400 to 500 feet per turn.  The angle of attack will be 18+ and 
airspeed will stabilize at 120 to 135 KIAS.  The turn needle will be fully deflected in 
the direction of the spin.  When performing spins to the left, the pilot may notice 
some differences in pitch attitude and magnitude of pitch, roll, and yaw oscillations.  
Spins in either direction may exhibit roll and yaw oscillations after 3 turns with 
neutral ailerons. 
 
Ailerons have a pronounced effect on spin characteristics.  With ailerons held in the 
direction of spin rotation, roll and yaw become noticeably oscillatory.  With ailerons 
held full opposite to direction of spin rotation, roll and yaw oscillations are damped 
out and the spin appears to reach steady-state in all axes.  You will keep ailerons 
neutral for all your spin training in the T-6B.

FLIGHT PROCEDURES    5-33 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Intentional Spin Entry 
 
i. CONFIGURATION:  Establish and trim the aircraft in slow cruise 
configuration (150 KIAS).  Trim will remain constant throughout the maneuver.  
Start the maneuver at an altitude so that the spin itself is entered below 22,000 
feet MSL, and recovered before 10,000 feet MSL. 
 
ii. CHECKLIST:  Perform the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
iii. CLEARING TURN:  Sufficiently clear the working area.  Since considerable 
altitude will be lost in the spin, be sure that the area below is clear of other 
aircraft or clouds.  TCAS “Below” mode may be used to aid clearing area 
below. 
 
iv. Roll out of the clearing turn, reducing the power setting to idle.  
 
v. Check the wings level and smoothly raise the nose (on the PFD) to 30º above 
the horizon.  When the gear warning horn activates, SNA shall acknowledge the 
warning horn.  At the IP’s discretion, SNA may silence the warning horn, 
however either the IP or the SNA shall silence the horn prior to spin entry. 
 
vi. At the stick shaker, lead the stall with a slight amount of rudder in the desired 
direction of spin.  Spins will be conducted in same direction as the last half of 
the clearing turn. 
 
vii. When the aircraft stalls (recognized by the nose pitching down), smoothly apply 
full rudder in the direction of spin and full back-stick.  Do not use aileron in the 
entry or during the spin. 
 
b. Spin Recovery (emphasizing departure recognition and recovery) 
 
After spin entry, initiate the “Inadvertent departure from controlled flight” procedure, 
in accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual. 
 
PCL – IDLE 
 
CONTROLS – NEUTRAL 
 
ALTITUDE – CHECK 
 
NOTE 
 
When positioning the controls to neutral, it is not uncommon to  
mistakenly position the elevator slightly aft of neutral. If the aircraft  
is not recovering as expected, slowly feed in forward stick until the  
neutral elevator position is reached and the aircraft recovers.

--- PAGE 112 ---
CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT 
 
5-34    FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
c. Spin Recovery (emphasizing anti-spin recovery procedures) 
 
i. At spin entry, scan inside the cockpit to verify sufficient altitude for recovery, 
stalled AOA, airspeed stabilized 120 to 135 KIAS and turn needle fully 
deflected in direction of spin, respectively. 
 
ii. After verifying stabilized spin indications, initiate the recovery from the spin by 
first applying full rudder opposite to the direction of rotation.  Follow 
immediately with smooth, positive forward stick to a position forward of 
neutral.  Do not use ailerons!  A common error is unintentionally placing the 
stick in the neutral or slightly aft of neutral position. 
 
NOTE 
 
SNAs will not be graded on the anti-spin recovery procedure. 
 
d. Recovery After Rotation Stops 
 
i. Hold the controls in position until the rotation stops, then recover with a 
minimum of altitude loss. 
 
(a) Neutralize the controls (if anti-spin recovery control inputs were used). 
 
(b) Level the wings by referencing the horizon. 
 
(c) Commence a smooth pullout.  Use sufficient G during pullout to maintain 
lower working area boundaries.  Avoid secondary stalls and do not exceed 
G limitations. 
 
ii. Continue the pullout until the nose is positioned to the level flight attitude.  
Recover with a minimum loss of altitude.  Emphasis is on smooth control 
inputs. 
 
iii. Check and report oil pressure (minimum of 90 psi). 
 
iv. Add power as required. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Not reducing the power setting to idle after rolling wings level from the clearing turn. 
 
b. Becoming disoriented and not initiating recovery.  
 
c. Not neutralizing the controls as the rotation stops.  
 
d. Commencing the pullout too rapidly and/or too early, resulting in a secondary stall.  

--- PAGE 113 ---

e. Insufficient G pull on recovery, resulting in inadvertently exiting lower working area 
boundaries. 
 
f. Not checking the oil pressure, late in adding power when level, and not reporting oil 
pressure to the instructor.  
 
g. Unintentionally placing the stick in the wrong position, either too far forward or aft.

LANDING PROCEDURES    6-1 
CHAPTER SIX 
LANDING PROCEDURES 
 
600. INTRODUCTION 
 
This chapter discusses the procedures and operations required for the T-6B to enter, land, and 
depart the landing pattern. 
 
601. LANDING PATTERN 
 
The landing pattern is a geometric racetrack-shaped course flown so that an approach and 
landing may be executed in a systematic sequence.  The landing line, the upwind leg, and the 
parallel downwind leg form the sides of the racetrack pattern.  These lines are joined together by 
the crosswind turn and by the approach turn at the downwind end of the pattern.  For purposes of 
clarity in this instruction, the landing pattern will be subdivided into three parts:  the pattern, 
approach, and landing. 
 
602. LANDING PATTERN TERMINOLOGY 
 
1. Visual Wing References 
 
a. Wingtip distance: Wingtip bisecting the intended point. 
 
b. ¾ Wingtip distance: Where the orange meets the white on the wing leading 
edge. 
 
c. ⅔ Wingtip distance:  Fuel cap. 
 
d. ¼ Wingtip distance:  Where the canopy rail visually bisects the wing. 
 
2. Initial Point.  A point over the ground at the appropriate distance from the runway as 
specified by the local SOP.  At this point the aircraft shall be: 
 
a. wings level. 
 
b. at break altitude. 
 
c. airspeed in accordance with local SOP. 
 
3. Break.  An overhead transition from cruise to the downwind configuration.  The break is 
basically a LSC conducted simultaneously with a constant angle of bank turn. 
 
4. Break Altitude.  Consult local SOP or Course Rules. 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 116 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-2    LANDING PROCEDURES 
5. Pattern Interval.  Determine the number of aircraft and visually acquire each aircraft to 
determine the proper interval.  You have "interval" when any of the following conditions occur: 
 
a. The aircraft ahead of you is abeam or behind your wingtip AND has completed  at 
least 90º of turn. 
 
b. The aircraft ahead has departed in accordance with course rules or simulated Low 
Altitude Power Loss from the Pattern (LAPL(P)) (T-34 only). 
 
c. At a tower-controlled field, the above conditions are met, AND you are cleared by the 
controller. 
 
d. If the preceding aircraft is a full stop, the proper interval is 45º behind your wingtip. 
 
NOTE 
 
If following an aircraft conducting AOA approaches, your 
instructor will judge the proper interval for the crosswind turn. 
 
6. Upwind.  The extended runway centerline past the departure end. 
 
7. Downwind.  That portion of the racetrack pattern offset from the runway in the opposite 
direction of landing. 
 
8. Crosswind Turn.  The turn between upwind and downwind. 
 
9. Abeam.  The position in the racetrack pattern opposite the intended point of landing at 
pattern altitude. 
 
10. 180º Position.  The position in the racetrack pattern opposite the intended rollout point. 
 
11. 90º Position.  The bisector between the 180 and intended rollout point.  The aircraft should 
be 450 feet AGL (or ½ the pattern altitude in feet AGL) and perpendicular to the runway.  
Airspeed is dependent on the type of approach.  (Civilian equivalent: Base Leg) 
 
12. Final.  The extended centerline of the runway with 1200-1500 feet of straightaway from 
the rollout point to the runway threshold at an altitude between 150-250 feet AGL.  Airspeed is 
dependent on the type of approach. 
 
13. Intended Point of Landing.  This is the point on the runway where you intend for the 
aircraft to touch down.  Intended Point of Landing is normally 500 feet past the runway 
threshold, or as defined by local SOP.  The Intended Point of landing may be changed as needed 
to account for unusual runway conditions such as a raised barrier or a displaced threshold. 
 
14. Touchdown Zone:  This is an area from the intended point of landing extending to 500 
feet beyond that point.  Strive to make all landings in the Touchdown Zone.  Safe landings may 

--- PAGE 117 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SIX 
 
LANDING PROCEDURES    6-3 
be made outside the touchdown zone, either prior to the Intended Point of Landing or past the 
Touchdown Zone.  If unable to execute a safe landing (within the first 1/3 of the runway or as 
determined by local SOP), WAVE OFF. 
 
15. Aimpoint:  A point in the runway approach end environment (i.e., runway numbers, 
runway threshold, etc.) used as a reference, or teaching tool, to fly the aircraft down final 
approach.  It is the reference point at the end of the aircraft's glide path where the transition to 
landing should commence.  It should not be confused with the intended point of landing or actual 
touchdown point.  The aimpoint should remain fixed in the windscreen on final approach when 
the aircraft is on speed and altitude ("in the groove").  Aimpoint selection directly relates to the 
resulting intended point of landing and actual touchdown point.  When selecting a proper 
aimpoint, winds, aircraft configuration, power settings, and airspeed must be considered. 
 
16. Landing Line.  This is the extended runway centerline.  It is a line over which the aircraft 
should track in on the final straightaway and landing. 
 
17. Wind Line.  This is an imaginary line parallel to the wind direction extending through the 
intended point of landing.  It may or may not coincide with the landing line.  If the landing line 
and wind line do not coincide with each other, a crosswind exists.  
 
18. Departure Interval.  You are number one for departure when past the departure end of the 
runway (or as defined by local SOP), flaps up, and the aircraft upwind has:  
 
a. Begun his crosswind turn. 
 
b. Raised his gear to depart. 
 
c. Conducted a simulated LAPL(P) (T -34 only). 
 
NOTES 
 
1. In order to depart, you do not have to be number one with 
interval, but you must be number one upwind.  There is a 
difference!  
 
2. Navy Corpus aircraft consult local course rules for departures 
from the downwind when applicable.  
 
603. OUTLYING FIELD ENTRY 
 
1. Description.  The outlying field entry (OFE) is a series of uniform procedures by which 
aircraft enter the landing pattern.  
 
 
 

--- PAGE 118 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-4    LANDING PROCEDURES 
2. General.  Since numerous (5-10) aircraft may be using the same outlying field (OLF) 
simultaneously, it is absolutely necessary that each aircraft conform to the same systematic 
pattern and standard operating procedures for safety and efficiency. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Determine the duty runway. 
 
b. Fly to establish the aircraft at the appropriate initial point.  At this point the aircraft 
shall be: 
 
i. on extended runway centerline and on runway heading. 
 
ii. wings level. 
 
iii. at break altitude (see local SOP). 
 
iv. airspeed in accordance with local SOP. 
 
c. When at the initial point, make the appropriate radio call. 
 
d. Fly from the initial point towards the runway maintaining altitude and airspeed, 
visually locate pattern traffic and obtain wind information. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Not selecting the appropriate outlying field channel. 
 
b. Not positioning the aircraft for the correct runway. 
 
c. Incorrect voice report. 
 
d. Not properly established at initial point. 
 
e. Not establishing the proper break interval. 
 
f. Continuing inbound for the break without two- way communications with the RDO. 
 
604. THE BREAK 
 
1. Description.  The outlying field break is a series of procedures to transition the aircraft 
from normal cruise configuration to the downwind configuration and position the aircraft on the 
downwind leg (Figure 6-1). 
 
2. General.  The following procedures will prepare the aircraft for landing at a field.

LANDING PROCEDURES    6-5 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Establish the proper interval.  Consult your local course rules for proper interva ls for 
other types of aircraft. 
 
b. With interval, execute the break in accordance with local SOP. 
 
c. Roll into a 45º AOB turn and maintain altitude.  
 
d. Reduce power as required (idle to approximately 10% torque) and extend the speed 
brake.  Trim for deceleration. 
 
e. Verbally confirm airspeed below 150 KIAS on the ICS prior to lowering the landing 
gear.

f. Halfway through the break turn, adjust the angle of bank to establish a ¾ wingtip 
distance on downwind. 
 
g. Slow to 120 KIAS, maintaining break altitude, trimming right rudder and up elevator 
for deceleration. 
 
h. Approaching 120 KIAS , retract the speed brake, lower the nose and descend at 120 
KIAS to pattern altitude (when directed by local SOP). 
 
i. Level off at pattern altitude using the P.A.T. principle: 
 
 

--- PAGE 121 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SIX 
 
LANDING PROCEDURES    6-7 
Power:  Approx imately 31% torque. 
Attitude: Stop the descent by initially setting a slightly nose-up attitude immediately 
followed by the 120 KIAS level flight attitude. 
Trim:  Re-trim. 
 
j. Once you are wings-level on downwind, conduct the Before Landing Checklist down 
to the flaps. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Not establishing proper interval. 
 
b. Poor attitude/altitude control in turn. 
 
c. Not trimming right/up. 
 
d. Not maintaining break altitude until reaching 120 KIAS. 
 
e. Not maintaining pattern altitude after descent from break altitude (i.e., settling below 
pattern altitude). 
 
605. LANDING PATTERN 
 
1. Description.  N/A 
 
2. General.  The pattern is the portion that commences with the break, or the takeoff 
following a touch-and-go or wave-off, and ends at the commencement of the approach turn 
(Figure 6–1).  The following limits will be observed in the pattern: 
 
a. 30-45º angle o f bank. 
 
b. 120 KIAS upwind with flaps up, crosswind, and downwind. 
 
c. Crosswind should not normally be initiated until past the departure end of the runway 
with interval.  Comply with local SOP. 
 
Interval permitting, the entire pattern can be flown in as little as 3 minutes.  There is not time for 
confusion or disorganization.  Inability to fly a safe, consistent landing pattern has been the 
pitfall of more Student Naval Aviators than all other failures combined. 
 
The cockpit workloads are high, but an in-depth understanding of what is to be accomplished and 
how to get it done will enable you to consistently shoot good passes.  Remember, you are only as 
good as your last pass. 
 
The following paragraphs are sequenced to fly you through the entire landing pattern and its 
options.  These procedures have worked for thousands of SNAs.  They will work for you.

CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-8    LANDING PROCEDURES 
606. APPROACH 
 
1. Description.  Make a descending 180º balanced turn to final in the No-flap, TO-flap, or 
LDG-flap configuration.  
 
Control:  AIRSPEED with NOSE ATTITUDE 
 
RATE of DESCENT with POWER 
 
2. General.  The approach is the portion that commences at the 180º position and ends with a 
full stop landing, touch-and-go, or wave-off.  This type of approach develops the student’s 
judgment and ability to control airspeed with nose attitude and rate of descent with power, while 
tracking a prescribed pattern over the ground under varying wind conditions.  It develops 
consistency in landing the aircraft on or near the intended point of landing. 
 
NOTE 
 
Pattern interval will be established in the break or crosswind turn 
and will NOT be corrected by variance of the approach from the 
180 to final.  If proper interval cannot be maintained, WAVE OFF. 
 
a. Downwind.  The downwind leg is flown at pattern altitude, at ¾ wingtip distance 
from the landing line at 120 KIAS using approximately 31% torque.  Once 
established on the downwind leg, perform the Before Landing Checklist. 
 
NOTE 
 
In perfectly calm wind conditions, the downwind heading 
(reciprocal of runway heading) will maintain the proper spacing 
once a ¾ WTD has been established.  However, this is not true 
when a crosswind exists.  If there is a crosswind, the aircraft will 
have to be angled (crabbed) sufficiently into the wind to prevent 
drifting into or away from the runway.  It is not uncommon to have 
to alter the downwind heading as much as 15º to maintain proper 
spacing abeam the runway. 
 
b. Transition.  The actual position where the transition is initiated will vary based on 
conditions such as winds, weight and aircraft configuration.  Initiate transition no 
sooner than the Abeam Position, but early enough to arrive at the 180 position in the 
proper flap configuration and the aircraft in a trimmed condition.  Begin the transition 
(if required) by lowering flaps to desired setting, reducing power smoothly towards 
the desired power setting, setting the appropriate attitude, and trim left rudder and up 
elevator.  Torque settings are approximately 12/15/18% for No-flap/TO-flap/LDG-
flap (NF/TF/LF) landings respectively.  A no-flap landing will not require a transition 
until the 180 since no airspeed or configuration change is made until the 180. 
 

--- PAGE 123 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SIX 
 
LANDING PROCEDURES    6-9 
NOTE 
 
Wind conditions must be considered when determining when to 
transition.  During perfectly calm wind conditions, the transition 
should normally begin at the abeam position. 
 
c. The 180.  This is the position on the downwind leg from which the approach turn is 
commenced, and is the point opposite the intended rollout point.  Upon reaching the 
180, commence the approach TURN by simultaneously lowering the nose to the 
120/115/110 KIAS (NF/TF/LF) approach attitude and smoothly turning toward the 
90º position.  Due to the transition power reduction, lowering the nose is necessary so 
as not to get slow. 
 
The pitch attitude of the aircraft in a full-flap approach is lower than in a no-flap 
approach.  The no-flap approach will typically require a slightly steeper angle of bank 
and further power reduction to achieve the proper racetrack pattern checkpoints.  
Maintain balanced flight.  Re-trim as necessary.  Do not use rudder (skid or slip) the 
aircraft through the turn.  One of the most important concepts to understand is that 
every approach must be started from the same relative position. 
 
The runway is a landmark.  Pilots are encouraged to look at it frequently.  Also, 
objects on the ground should be used as pattern checkpoints so as to fly the same 
consistent path over the ground regardless of wind.  When ground checkpoints around 
the pattern are available, they can be used in getting to the final checkpoint, the 
runway.  The more experience you have, the more you will look out the canopy to 
compensate for abnormal conditions.  It is rather hard to fly the same path over the 
ground unless you look at the ground. 
 
After starting the approach turn: 
 
i. TALK, give appropriate 180 call in accordance with SOP. 
 
ii. Then check and report on the ICS, "Gear down, flaps UP /TO/LDG, speed brake 
retracted, Before Landing Checklist complete." 
 
Vary the angle of bank and adjust the nose attitude/rate of descent as necessary to 
arrive at a proper 90º position.  Use ground checkpoints. 
 
d. The 90.  The 90º position is a fixed position at the midpoint of the approach turn at 
which the aircraft’s heading is 90º from the runway heading.  The aircraft should pass 
through this position at 120/115/110 KIAS (NF/TF/LF) and 450 feet AGL or ½ the 
pattern altitude in feet AGL.  (Figure 6-2).

Figure 6-2  90° Position 
 
Continue to fly the aircraft from the 90º position and anticipate a rate of turn which 
will enable you to intercept the extended runway centerline with 1200-1500 feet of 
straightaway from the threshold, 150-250 feet AGL, and wings level.  Once on final, 
decelerate to final approach speed of 110/105/100 KIAS (NF/TF/LF).  If on profile at 
the 90º position, a slight power reduction will be required in order to initiate 
deceleration once wings level on final.  Check and report on the ICS IAW local SOP. 
 
The need for corrections in the approach must be recognized as soon as possible and 
the actual corrections must be small to avoid over correction.  Although power 
controls the rate of descent and the nose attitude controls the airspeed, it must be 
remembered that the combination of attitude (nose and wing) and power work 
together to produce aircraft performance.  Any change in attitude (nose or wing) to 
maintain the proper glidepath will require a corresponding change in power.  No 
written outline can effectively state all possible errors in a landing approach.  The 
procedures that are utilized to correct for deviations from the desired altitude/airspeed 
are those learned on your first flight.  Remember, the combination of attitude and 
power work together to produce aircraft performance. 
 
e. The "final" (straightaway or groove) is that final portion of the landing approach, 
beginning at a point 1200-1500 feet from the runway threshold at an altitude of 150-
250 feet AGL where the aircraft is first aligned, wings-level and ends with the 
landing transition.  The length of the straightaway should provide 8-10 seconds prior 
to landing (Figure 6-3).

LANDING PROCEDURES    6-11 
The entire pattern to this point is designed to position the aircraft to intercept the cone 
that is the glideslope groove.  The rate of descent must be adjusted and readjusted in 
order to achieve and maintain a constant rate of descent, but also to stabilize the 
glideslope "picture."  Power required will vary with wind conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6-3  The "Groove" 
 
The secret to a good approach is to solve lineup problems early.  After rolling out on 
straightaway, if the centerline is not between your legs, correct immediately and 
positively.  Following this correction, continue to scan lineup, making small 
corrections as necessary.  Do not ease yourself to centerline, or a counter-correction 
will have to be made close to the touchdown point of the runway.  
 
Rolling wings level while aligning the airplane with the runway centerline, the nose 
attitude should be maintained and a slight reduction in power may be necessary to 
compensate for the increase in lift.  Slight adjustments in pitch, changes of nose 
attitude, and power may be necessary to maintain the descent attitude while gradually 
decelerating.  When the nose attitude and airspeed have been stabilized, the airplane 
should be re-trimmed to relieve the pressures on the controls.  Do not slow below 
110/105/100 KIAS until commencing the landing transition.  Crosscheck airspeed 
with AOA.  At higher aircraft weights, higher airspeeds may be required to maintain 
on speed (amber donut) AOA indication.  Adjust nose attitude and power 
accordingly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6-4  The "Straightaway" 
 

--- PAGE 126 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-12    LANDING PROCEDURES 
The straightaway portion of the approach has some very closely defined dimensions 
and these enable the pilot to establish constant visual checkpoints.  The dimensions 
are depicted in Figure 6-4. 
 
To maintain a constant glideslope, it is necessary to maintain a fairly constant 
airspeed and rate of descent.  Given that the aircraft has a constant attitude for each 
airspeed, power, and configuration combination, we will be able to reference the nose 
position to glideslope and aimpoint. 
 
Mentally superimpose our symbolic aircraft on the glideslope and you should see that 
by maintaining airspeed (meticulously) and a constant sight picture of the touchdown 
zone, you will maintain a constant rate of descent to land in a predictable area of the 
runway. 
 
If your airspeed is "locked on" and your aimpoint appears to be running away from 
you, your aircraft is falling below the desired glideslope.  Add power, raise the nose 
to maintain airspeed and fly back up to the glideslope.  Anticipate a slight power 
reduction when back on glideslope and lower the nose to the approach attitude to 
reestablish the rate of descent. 
 
Conversely, if your aimpoint disappears beneath the nose and airspeed is "locked on," 
you have flown above the glideslope and need to reduce power.  Lower the nose, 
thereby increasing the rate of descent while maintaining airspeed.  Anticipate a slight 
power addition once reestablished on glideslope and readjust the nose attitude to "set" 
the desired rate of descent (Figure 6-5).

LANDING PROCEDURES    6-13 
Balanced flight must be maintained throughout the approach.  An unbalanced flight 
condition increases the stalling speed, gives an erroneous impression of the flight path 
of the aircraft, and may cause difficulty during the subsequent landing transition, 
touchdown, and/or landing rollout.  Fly the aircraft smoothly; avoid sudden or erratic 
control movements.  Remember, good basic airwork and proper trim are mandatory in 
the approach.  The proper amount of rudder and up elevator trim will enable the 
aircraft to "fly itself" with very little control pressure.  The key to a good landing is a 
good approach.  
 
f. There are three general areas to consider in flying a good approach. 
 
i. SCAN.  A rapid integrated scan pattern is a necessity.  The exterior cues of the 
"picture" and landing area alignment, and the internal cues of tactile sensation 
and inner ear ("seat-of-the-pants"), must be "scanned" and integrated with 
instrument readings for an accurate total appraisal of the pilot’s present 
situation.  Anticipation of trends and early corrections can then be made. 
 
ii. FUNNEL EFFECT.  Because of the cone shape of the straightaway/groove, 
large corrections may be made while far out, and small corrections in close. 
 
iii. COUNTER-CORRECTION.  For every correction that is made, there will be 
a counter-correction necessary to achieve stability.  The overall goal is to 
achieve stability of attitude and rate of descent, and cross the runway at a 
precise altitude on the centerline of the landing area.  Stability of the above 
factors must not be construed to mean that power and controls are necessarily 
stable.  Smoothness comes from recognizing errors early, through a rapid scan, 
and being able to make a small correction before the aircraft deviates outside of 
the cone.  
 
The glideslope (altitude) is controlled primarily with power, and the attitude/ 
airspeed primarily with the stick, but it cannot be overemphasized that there 
must be a coordinated use of both in any correction.  In analyzing a situation, 
there are two basic elements to be considered:  speed (either fast or slow) and 
altitude (either high or low).  There are many possible combinations of these 
elements, which will compound the error analysis and correction.  The 
following is a list of the most common deviations and corrections to ensure the 
"perfect approach," Figure 6-6.

Figure 6-6  Glideslope Corrections 
 
(a) HIGH - To correct a high situation, reduce power slightly and lower the 
nose to maintain airspeed with nose attitude.  Power should be reduced, 
because it is probably why the aircraft got high in the first place.  Do not 
reduce power excessively.  DO NOT attempt to correct for being high 
once over the runway.  Attempting to do so will result in a hard landing, 
which could cause structural damage to the aircraft.  
 
(b) LOW - NEVER accept being low.  To correct a low situation, add power 
and raise the nose to maintain airspeed.  The nose attitude correction is 
vital.  Attitude must be adjusted if the correction is to be timely.  Adding 
power alone will merely accelerate the aircraft.

(c) FAST - To correct, reduce power slightly while simultaneously applying 
slight backpressure on the stick.  Readjust power when the aircraft 
decelerates to the proper airspeed.  
 
(d) SLOW - To correct, add power and apply forward pressure to the stick to 
increase airspeed.  Reduce power and readjust nose attitude when the 
aircraft reaches the proper airspeed.

607. LANDINGS  
 
1. Description.  Land smoothly on the main-mounts at the intended point of landing on 
runway centerline.  
 
2. General.  Landing is divided into three phases:  1) Landing Transition, 2) Flare and 
Touchdown, and 3) Landing Roll.  Each of these phases serves as a transition from the previous 
phase to the next.  The landing transition serves as the transition from final to the flare; the 
descent rate on final is drastically reduced as the flight path becomes near horizontal in the flare.  
The flare is used to reduce energy in the transition from final to landing airspeed.  The landing 
roll serves as the transition from landing to taxi.  Airspeed is reduced straight-ahead on the 
runway until at safe taxi speed. 
 
Landing Transition.  Start power reduction and reduce descent rate.  Power reduction reduces 
energy and helps prevent level-off as aimpoint is shifted.  Descent rate is reduced by shifting the 
aim point progressively further down the runway.  As descent and airspeed decrease, power is 
slowly reduced (ultimately to idle in the flare). 
 
Flare and Touchdown.  In the flare, back-stick pressure is slowly increased as power is reduced 
and airspeed decreases.  The aircraft will be in a slight descent or level flight depending on 
altitude, airspeed, power setting, and rate of deceleration.  Use caution to avoid excess back-stick 
which could lead to a climb in the flare.  As the nose rises, forward visibility is reduced and 
peripheral vision becomes the key factor in height and drift assessment.  Touchdown is simply an 
end to the flare and should occur as landing speed is attained.  
 
When landing is assured, smoothly retard the PCL to idle and continue back-stick pressure to 
increase the pitch attitude until the proper landing attitude is reached.  As descent rate and 
airspeed decrease, the aircraft gently settles onto the runway.  Ensure PCL is idle at touchdown. 
 
Flare at a rate proportional to the rate of descent.  For example, higher descent rates require 
faster application of back-stick to attain normal descent rate prior to touchdown and prevent a 
firm landing.  Similarly, a lower than normal descent rate requires slower control stick 
movement to prevent a high flare.  
 
 

--- PAGE 132 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-18    LANDING PROCEDURES 
Maintain crosswind controls (wing-low) throughout the flare.  As the airspeed decreases towards 
landing speed, use additional aileron and rudder deflection to maintain runway alignment.  
Crosswind controls increase drag, rate of deceleration, and stall speed. 
 
In the flare, power can compensate for errors in judgment.  Faster or slower power reductions 
can compensate for errors made in the landing transition and early flare.  Apply power and go-
around any time the controls feel mushy, the aircraft experiences an approach-to-stall indication, 
or if an excessively long touchdown will occur. 
 
Crosswind controls must be held through touchdown and landing roll to prevent the upwind wing 
from rising and the aircraft from skipping.  With significant crosswinds, expect the upwind main 
gear to touch down before the downwind main gear.  
 
If power is used during the flare, retard the PCL to idle at touchdown. 
 
After touchdown on a full-stop landing, slightly relax back-stick pressure and allow the nose 
gear to settle onto the runway.  Avoid banging the nose gear. 
 
Ensure your feet are not on the brakes when the aircraft touches down. 
 
Landing Roll.  With the nose gear on the runway and below 80 KIAS, smoothly apply brakes 
and increase back-stick pressure.  This increases weight on the main gear and helps prevent the 
nose gear from digging in, however, do not allow the nose gear to lift off the runway.  
Continually increase back-stick and brake pressure as the aircraft decelerates.  Always brake in a 
straight line; do not turn and brake.  Maintain directional control with rudder and/or brakes.  Use 
caution to avoid over-controlling when applying brakes. 
 
Maintain crosswind controls throughout the landing roll.  As the airspeed decreases, crosswind 
control deflection must increase to achieve the same effect.  Proper use of aileron prevents a 
crosswind from lifting the upwind wing.  When rudder effectiveness is lost, full aileron 
deflection may be necessary. 
 
Confirm N
1 reduction from 67-60% shortly after main gear touchdown (approximately 4 
seconds). 
 
Do not select NWS until the aircraft is at normal taxi speed.  Center rudder pedals before 
selecting NWS.  At higher speeds, NWS is extremely sensitive.  Before reaching taxi speed, use 
NWS only if directional control cannot be maintained with rudder and brakes. 
 
If you encounter nose wheel shimmy during the landing roll, apply back-stick pressure to relieve 
weight on the nose wheel, and then gently release pressure to reestablish nose wheel contact with 
the runway.  If condition persists, reapply back-stick pressure.  Strong crosswinds, a low strut, or 
a low runway condition reading (RCR); for example, wet or icy runway, all influence 
controllability after landing.

PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SIX 
 
LANDING PROCEDURES    6-19 
The physical limitations of the tire and brake system make it extremely difficult to consistently 
achieve optimum braking action, particularly at high speeds as lift reduces the weight 
component.  A single, smooth application, with increasing pressure as airspeed decreases, offers 
the best braking potential.  At speeds below 80 KIAS, the chances of approaching optimum 
braking action are greatly increased.  Use caution when braking at speeds above 80 KIAS.  Do 
not allow the wheels to lock during braking.  Once a wheel is locked, it may be necessary to 
completely release brake pressure to allow wheel rotation. 
 
At taxi speed, engage the NWS prior to initiating turns.  Do not complete any After Landing 
Checklist items until clear of the runway. 
 
Touch-and-Go Landing.  When making touch-and-go landings, utilize the P.A.T. principle by 
smoothly applying the power to MAX without delay.  Remember that right rudder pressure will 
be required as the engine spools up.  As power becomes available following engine spool-up, 
and with 85 KIAS minimum, raise the nose to the takeoff attitude and allow the aircraft to 
smoothly take off.  Once a positive rate of climb is confirmed, retract the flaps (leave gear 
down).  Re-trim and climb out at 120 KIAS.  When number one upwind with interval, make a 
crosswind call on the radio (as required) and commence a turn to the downwind leg using a  
30-45° AOB.  Fifty feet prior to pattern altitude, begin the transition to level off at pattern 
altitude by reducing power to approximately 31% torque, then lowering the nose to maintain 120 
KIAS and trim.  
 
NOTE 
 
Retraction of flaps from the TO to the UP position is not 
recommended below 110 KIAS to preclude the aircraft from 
settling back to the runway.  However, there is no minimum to 
raise the flaps from the LDG to the TO position. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Landing Transition to Touchdown 
 
i. Approaching touchdown (5-10’ AGL)  smoothly reduce PCL towards idle.  
 
ii. Coordinate gradual back-stick pressure to land smoothly on the main mounts in 
a nose-high attitude. 
 
b. Roll-out 
 
i. Maintain flared back-stick pressure.  As speed decreases you will feel a 
corresponding loss of lift.  As the nose begins to settle, slightly reduce back-
stick pressure and allow the nose to smoothly touch down.  
 
ii. Maintain directional control using rudders only.

CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-20    LANDING PROCEDURES 
c. Full-Stop Landing 
 
i. Smoothly move the PCL to idle. 
 
ii. With the nose gear on the runway and below 80 kts, smoothly apply brakes and 
increase back-stick pressure.  This increases weight on the main gear and helps 
prevent the nose gear from digging in, however, do not allow the nose gear to 
lift off the runway.  When executing a normal full stop landing, check airspeed 
and verbalize “Airspeed below 80 kts” before initiating smooth braking.  Use 
the double the board method to determine approximate appropriate airspeed 
control during a normal full stop landing roll.  Speed should be between 60-70 
kts with three thousand feet remaining (3 board), 40-50 kts with 2000 feet 
remaining (2 board) and 20-30 kts with 1000 feet remaining (1 board).  
Maintain aircraft control while expediting rollout to the end of the runway.  
Turn off the runway once the aircraft is safely under control at taxi speed. 
 
iii. Continually increase back- stick and brake pressure as the aircraft decelerates. 
Always brake in a straight line; do not turn and brake.  Maintain directional 
control with rudder and/or brakes.  Use caution to avoid over-controlling when 
applying brakes.  Confirm N
1 reduction from 67-60% shortly after main gear 
touchdown (approximately 4 seconds). 
 
iv. Do not select NWS until the aircraft is at normal taxi speed.  Center rudder 
pedals before selecting NWS.  At higher speeds, NWS is extremely sensitive. 
Before reaching taxi speed, use NWS only if directional control cannot be 
maintained with rudder and brakes.  
 
d. Touch-and-Go Landing 
 
i. Move PCL to full forward without delay.  As power becomes available 
following engine spool-up, apply right rudder and with a minimum of 85 KIAS 
raise the nose to the takeoff attitude.  
 
ii. Execute a normal takeoff, once a positive rate of climb is confirmed, and 
airspeed is 110 KIAS minimum, retract the flaps (leave gear down).  Trim.  
 
iii. As airspeed approaches 120 KIAS, reduce power to 60-70% and climb straight 
ahead. 
 
iv. Once trimmed at 120 KIAS and with proper interval, make the crosswind radio 
call and begin the crosswind turn using 30-45° AOB. 
 
v. Rollout on downwind with ¾ WTD spacing from the runway. 
 
vi. 50 feet prior to pattern altitude, transition to level flight by reducing power to 
~31%.

a. Uncoordinated transition with power reduction and nose attitude, resulting in a rapid 
or late flare. 
 
b. Landing too short or too long. 
 
c. Floating, ballooning, bouncing and full- stall landings. 
 
d. Excessive sink rate due to excessive power reduction, otherwise known as the 
"bucket." 
 
e. Not rechecking landing gear after intercepting the final. 
 
f. Not executing a wave-off for any unsafe condition. 
 
608. CROSSWIND APPROACH 
 
1. Description.  Compensate for crosswinds in the landing pattern to maintain the normal 
ground track. 
 
2. General.  All pilots should be able to assess crosswinds and understand how they affect 
pattern operations.  The proper application of crosswind controls is essential to executing 
landings.  Consider using TO Flaps if crosswinds are greater than 10 knots or during gusty wind 
conditions.  Consider using no flaps if crosswinds are greater than 20 knots and landing distance 
is not a factor. 
 
Prevailing crosswinds are normally broken down into two categories according to how they will 
affect the aircraft:  “overshooting” or “undershooting”. 
 
Overshooting.  Overshooting crosswinds will cause the aircraft to fly a track outside the 
normal final ground track.  Ground speed in the final turn will be higher than normal.  As a 
result, slightly lower than normal power settings and slightly more angle of bank will be 
required around the final turn to compensate for a higher required rate of descent.

Figure 6-8  Overshooting Crosswind 
 
Undershooting.  Undershooting crosswind will cause the aircraft to fly a track inside the 
normal final ground track.  Ground speed in the final turn will be lower than normal.  As a 
result, slightly higher than normal power settings and slightly less angle of bank will be 
required around the final turn to compensate for a lower required rate of descent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6-9  Undershooting Crosswind 
 
In order to maintain a particular track or desired path over the ground, it will be necessary to 
“crab” or turn into the wind slightly.  Therefore, when climbing out upwind or flying downwind, 
to maintain the desired path over the ground, you must crab into the wind slightly (Figures 6-10 
and 6-11).

Execution. 
 
Final Turn.  The normal Angle of Bank used at the start of the final turn should be 
approximately 30°.  For overshooting winds, increased bank may be required to avoid 
overshooting final.  While 45° of bank is acceptable if required, caution must be exercised as 
stall speed increases with increasing bank angle.  Do not exceed 45° bank during the final turn.  
If bank required to complete the final turn is greater than 45°, initiate a waveoff. 
 
For undershooting winds, you may be required to use less bank to avoid angling on final and 
rolling out too close to the runway.  Vary the angle of bank, power setting, or both in order to 
arrive at the landing line 1200-1500 feet from the runway threshold, and 150-250 feet of altitude 
at the proper airspeed. 
 
NOTE 
 
It is imperative to roll out at a proper distance from the runway to 
ensure enough time to assess the crosswinds and apply proper 
crosswind controls. 
 
During gusty wind conditions, increase final approach airspeed by 
½ the gust factor up to a 10 knot increase.  For example, with 8 
knots of gust, increase final approach airspeed by 4 KIAS. 
 
Final.  After rolling out on final, the aircraft should be crabbed into the wind to avoid drifting off 
centerline.  The amount of crab required on final indicates the amount of control deflection 
needed to transition to the wing-low method. 
 
Wing-low.  After rolling out on final, transition to the wing-low method by applying: 
 
a. Rudder deflection to align the longitudinal axis of the aircraft with the runway.  
 
b. Aileron into the wind as necessary to keep the aircraft from drifting left or right or the 
runway centerline.  
 
c. Additional power, as required, to counteract increased drag due to cross controls. 
 
d. Maintain wing-low control inputs throughout flare and landing roll out or touch-and-
go. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Maintain proper distance downwind with a crab. 
 
b. Adjust power and bank angle to fly a normal ground track in the final turn.

c. Execute a waveoff if unable to avoid overshooting final without using more than 45° 
angle of bank. 
 
d. Upon intercepting the landing line after rolling out on final, observe the magnitude of 
drift and establish the proper correction. 
 
4. Common Errors 
 
a. Not recognizing when a crosswind exists. 
 
b. Not executing a waveoff when appropriate. 
 
609. CROSSWIND LANDING 
 
1. Description.  Compensate for crosswinds and land smoothly at the intended point of 
landing on runway centerline. 
 
2. General.  Throughout the final, flare and touchdown, the aircraft should track in a straight 
line down the runway.  The application of crosswind correction must be continued as necessary 
during the landing transition and flare to prevent drift.  Since airspeed decreases as the flare 
progresses, the flight controls gradually become less effective; as a result, the crosswind 
correction being held will become inadequate.  When using the wing-low method, it is necessary 
to gradually increase deflection of aileron into the wind as the aircraft decelerates.  As torque 
decreases, the nose of the aircraft will yaw right.  This yaw must also be accounted for on final. 
 
Do not level the wings; keep the upwind wing down throughout the flare.  Think of flaring over 
one wheel.  As the forward momentum decreases, the weight of the aircraft will cause the other 
main wheel to settle onto the runway.  If the wings are leveled prior to touchdown, the airplane 
will begin drifting and the touchdown will occur while drifting. 
 
During gusty or high wind conditions, extreme caution should be used to make certain that the 
aircraft is not drifting or crabbing.  A crab is a condition that occurs when a touchdown is 
executed while the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is not aligned with the runway.  Since the 
aircraft is actually traveling sideways in relation to the runway, it will impart a tipping moment 
in the direction that the aircraft is traveling.  Touchdown in a crab or drift will also cause the 
aircraft to turn away from the intended landing path.  This turn is called a swerve.  Any time a 
swerve develops, centrifugal force will be created commensurate to the speed of the swerve.  It is 
dangerous to land in a crab or drift and could potentially cause the aircraft to depart the runway.  
If unable to apply proper crosswind controls before touchdown, or an uncontrollable drift 
occurs during the flare, WAVEOFF! 
 
Full Stop.  During the landing roll, special attention must be given to maintaining directional 
control with rudders while maintaining crosswind aileron inputs.  While the airplane is 
decelerating during the landing roll, more and more aileron must be applied to keep the upwind 
wing from rising.  Since the airplane is slowing down, there is less airflow over the ailerons and 
they become less effective.  At the same time, the relative wind is becoming more of a crosswind 

--- PAGE 140 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-26    LANDING PROCEDURES 
and exerting a greater lifting force on the upwind wing.  Consequently, when the airplane is 
coming to a stop, the aileron control must be held fully towards the winds.  Always brake in a 
straight line; do not turn and brake.  Maintain directional control with rudder and/or differential 
braking while applying aileron deflection into the wind.  If landing occurred off runway 
centerline, do not attempt to aggressively correct back toward the center of the runway!  If the 
aircraft becomes uncontrollable after initial touchdown, GO AROUND. 
 
Touch-and-Go.  Hold the nosewheel on the deck and apply upwind aileron to maintain a wings-
level attitude.  Initiate positive (firm) rotation when flying speed is reached to avoid side-
slipping.  Initial drift correction is made by turning into the wind with a shallow bank to 
counteract drift, then rolling wings-level.  On the climbout, it will be necessary to “crab” the 
aircraft into the wind to maintain runway heading.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Maintain crosswind correction through the landing transition using slight adjustments 
of rudder and aileron as necessary. 
 
b. Apply rudder as required to align the aircraft with the runway.  Increase aileron 
pressure as necessary to land the aircraft with zero side motion. 
 
c. Add power as required to maintain glideslope. 
 
d. Landing will be made on the upwind main mount first. 
 
e. Maintain crosswind corrections to minimize weathervaning and lower the nose to the 
runway. 
 
f. For full stop landings: 
 
i. Increase aileron into the wind as the airplane decelerates. 
 
ii. Use rudder as required to continue straight down the runway. 
 
iii. Smoothly apply brakes below 80 KIAS.  Maintain directional control with 
rudder and/or brakes while applying aileron deflection into the wind. 
 
g. For touch- and-go landings: 
 
i. Hold in crosswind controls throughout ground roll. 
 
ii. Firmly rotate the aircraft to the takeoff attitude. 
 
h. If unable to apply proper crosswind controls before touchdown, or an uncontrollable 
drift occurs during the flare, WAVEOFF!

4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Landing with any side motion. 
 
b. Landing in a crab. 
 
c. Not holding in corrections while on the runway. 
 
d. Not executing a waveoff when necessary. 
 
e. Overcorrecting back towards runway centerline. 
 
f. Not increasing aileron deflection into the wind during a full stop. 
 
g. Not crabbing upwind after a touch- and-go, causing a drift from runway centerline. 
 
h. Not checking airspeed before applying brakes. 
 
610. WAVEOFF (GO-AROUND)  
 
1. Description.  The wave-off is a set of standard procedures used to effect the safe 
discontinuation of an approach. 
 
2. General.  Occasionally, during your landing practice, you will have to discontinue an 
approach and execute a waveoff.  A waveoff may be initiated by the pilot, or may be directed by 
an external source (RDO, wheels watch, waveoff lights, IP, tower, another aircraft, etc.).  The 
reason for an externally directed waveoff may not be apparent to the pilot, but the waveoff is 
mandatory unless a greater emergency exists.  Do not confuse a waveoff with a stall recovery.  If 
a stall indication occurs in the landing pattern, disregard ground track and execute the stall 
recovery procedures.  After safely climbing away from the ground, reestablish the proper ground 
track and execute a waveoff. 
 
Although a landing approach may be aborted at any point in the pattern, a waveoff will usually 
be executed during the approach turn, in the straightaway, or during the landing transition.  Of 
course, the sooner a poor landing condition is recognized and the waveoff executed, the safer it 
will be.  Do not delay the decision to waveoff and do not try to salvage a bad approach.  If at any 
time your approach does not feel comfortable or you are too close to the aircraft in front of you, 
"take it around."  You should not wait until the last second to make a decision.  Keep in mind 
that a waveoff is not an emergency procedure unless it is executed too late.  A pilot who 
recognizes a poor approach situation and executes a proper waveoff well before getting into a 
dangerous situation is demonstrating maturity and good judgment and will never be criticized by 
fellow aviators.  Be alert for a waveoff given by wheels watch (radio call or waveoff lights).  
Once you have initiated a waveoff, do not change your mind and attempt to land.  
 
 
 

--- PAGE 142 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-28    LANDING PROCEDURES 
Examples of an unsafe approach are unsafe altitude, unsafe airspeed, overshooting approach, 
drifting or crabbing prior to touchdown, and high transitions that will lead to a bounced landing. 
The sooner a poor landing condition is recognized and the waveoff executed, the safer it will be. 
 
Conflicts in the traffic pattern and insufficient separation during the landing approach are usually 
solved by establishing proper interval in the break or upwind prior to the crosswind turn; 
however, the following guidelines should be followed. 
 
There should be at least 90º of approach turn between you and the aircraft ahead.  If you roll out 
in the straightaway before the aircraft has landed, an immediate waveoff shall be initiated.  Do 
not delay your waveoff in hopes that the situation will correct itself.  During operations at 
outlying fields where Practice Precautionary Emergency Landing (PPEL), PPEL in the pattern, 
and touch-and-go are in progress simultaneously, pilots must be constantly alert for traffic 
conflicts.  PPEL traffic has the right-of-way over normal touch-and-go traffic. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Advance PCL; MAX power may not always be required.  Aircraft deconfliction, 
maneuvering requirements, and traffic pattern may warrant the use of something other 
than MAX power. 
 
b. Simultaneously level the wings (if conditions permit), and center the ball.  
 
c. Raise the nose to climbing attitude and climb at 120 KIAS.  Re- trim.  
 
NOTE 
 
When the aircraft is under control, make a radio transmission that 
you are waving off.  
 
d. If flaps were lowered, when safely airborne, at or above 110 KIAS, with a positive 
rate of climb, raise the flaps and then accelerate to 120 KIAS.  Reduce power to 60-
70%, re-trim.  
 
e. Adjust your flight path, moving to either side of the runway if necessary, to avoid 
conflicting traffic and to keep aircraft on the runway in sight.  Comply with any 
instructions given to you from the tower/RDO.  If the wave-off was performed on 
final or during the landing transition with no other aircraft on the runway, the wave-
off may be performed directly over the runway (unless prohibited by SOP). 
 
NOTE 
 
Wave-off shall continue to follow ground track to avoid traffic and 
comply with local course rules.  
 
f. With interval, call crosswind to re-enter downwind or depart the pattern.

4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to initiate waveoff early enough.  
 
b. Failure to advance PCL as required.  
 
c. Failure to establish aircraft in a positive rate of climb.  
 
d. Failure to maintain 120 KIAS.  
 
e. Forgetting to raise the flaps.  
 
f. Forgetting to transmit waveoff call.  
 
g. Failure to maintain solid lookout doctrine and keep other aircraft in sight. 
 
611. LANDING ERRORS 
 
1. Description.  A deviation from a normal landing which could cause a dangerous situation 
to quickly develop. 
 
2. General.  Airspeed in the flare is only slightly above stall airspeed.  Even at slow 
airspeeds, the elevator is still very effective.  An abrupt change in pitch could result in a balloon, 
a bounce, or even a stall.  When any of these conditions are encountered, apply MAX power, 
adjust the pitch attitude and WAVEOFF if it is unsafe to continue the landing.  If power is 
applied and the aircraft continues to settle, do not try to hold it off by raising the nose above the 
landing attitude.  Hold the landing attitude and let the aircraft touch down.  MAX power 
cushions the touch down.  In case of a hard landing, do not raise the gear.  The following are 
examples of landing errors. 
 
a. High Flare: 
 
Cause.  Flare performed too early or with excessive pitch up.  Flare begun too early 
or with excessive pitch up. 
 
Effects. 
 
Inability to flare normally due to excess altitude. 
 
Possible premature touchdown of nose gear caused by abrupt pitch down to 
compensate for high flare. 
 
Stall if flare continued with excess altitude. 
 
Hard landing due to high sink rates as airspeed decreases at higher than normal 
altitude. 

--- PAGE 144 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-30    LANDING PROCEDURES 
Recovery.  With adequate airspeed and runway remaining, release a small amount of 
backpressure to increase descent rate.  As aircraft approaches normal altitude, 
increase backpressure to reestablish normal flare. 
 
If too high on final, causing an excessively steep glideslope, do not attempt landing, 
WAVEOFF.  Remember, as landing attitude is attained, the aircraft is rapidly 
approaching a stall and there is insufficient margin-of-error for radical pitch changes 
in the flare. 
 
b. Late or Rapid Flare : 
 
Cause.  Higher than expected descent rate or misjudged altitude. 
 
Effects. 
 
Firm touchdown due to higher than normal descent rates or insufficient time to 
complete flare. 
 
Abrupt flare to prevent premature or firm touchdown may lead to an accelerated stall.  
This is a dangerous situation that may cause an extremely hard landing and damage to 
the main gear.  This may or may not be a controllable situation, depending on 
airspeed. 
 
Recovery.  Hold landing attitude and add power.  Immediate use of power increases 
thrust, lift, and controllability while simultaneously decreasing AOA and enables a 
recovery and waveoff.  The main gear may contact the ground a second time, but if 
recovered properly, the second contact is usually moderate. 
 
c. Porpoising: 
 
Cause.  Incorrect (flat) landing attitude and airspeed.  At touchdown, the nose gear 
contacts the runway before the main gear. 
 
Effects.  
 
The aircraft bounces back and forth between the nose gear and main gear.  Without 
immediate corrective action, the porpoise progresses to a violent, unstable pitch 
oscillation.  Repeated heavy impacts on the runway ultimately cause structural 
damage to the landing gear and airframe. 
 
Recovery.  Immediately position the controls to the takeoff attitude (spinner 
approximately on the horizon) to prevent the nose wheel from contacting the runway 
and simultaneously advance the PCL to MAX and GO AROUND. 
 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 145 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SIX 
 
LANDING PROCEDURES    6-31 
Do not attempt to counteract each bounce with opposite control stick movement.  The 
combined reaction time of pilot and aircraft is such that this control movement 
aggravates the porpoise.  Hold the controls in the recovery position to dampen the 
oscillations.  Power increases control effectiveness by increasing airspeed. 
 
d. Floating: 
 
Cause.  Late power reduction, excessive airspeed, or improper flap setting. 
 
Effects.  Long landing.  Possible balloon or bounce. 
 
Recovery.  Dependent on magnitude of float and runway remaining. 
 
For a slight float, gradually increase pitch attitude as airspeed decreases and landing 
speed is approached. 
 
Avoid prolonged floating, especially in strong crosswinds.  If a long landing (outside 
safe landing zone) is inevitable, WAVEOFF. 
 
e. Ballooning: 
 
Cause.  Rapid flare.  Rapidly raising the nose to the landing attitude with excessive 
airspeed. 
 
Effects.  Altitude gain (dependent on airspeed and pitch rate). 
 
Recovery.  Landing may be completed from a slight balloon.  Hold landing attitude 
as the aircraft settles to runway.  Maintain wing-low crosswind controls through the 
balloon and landing.  WAVEOFF from a pronounced balloon.  Do not attempt to 
salvage the landing. 
 
f. Bounce: 
 
Causes. 
 
Overly firm or hard touchdown causes aircraft to bounce off runway. 
 
Contact with ground before landing attitude is attained.  Landing with excessive rate 
of descent/energy. 
 
Late recognition that aircraft is settling too fast, combined with excessive back-stick 
pressure. 
 
Effects.  Height reached depends on the force with which the aircraft strikes the 
runway, the amount of back-stick pressure held, and the speed at touchdown. 
 
Recovery.  Same as a balloon, depending on severity of bounce. 

--- PAGE 146 ---
CHAPTER SIX PRIMARY CONTACT 
6-32    LANDING PROCEDURES 
Slight Bounce.  Continue the landing.  Maintain direction with wing-low crosswind 
controls and smoothly adjust pitch to the landing attitude just before touchdown. 
 
Severe Bounce (aircraft rising rapidly).  Do not attempt a landing, WAVEOFF 
immediately. 
 
Simultaneously apply MAX power, maintain direction, and set a safe pitch attitude. 
Continue waveoff even if another bounce occurs. 
 
Bouncing in Crosswinds.  Use extreme caution.  When one wheel strikes the 
runway, the other wheel touches down immediately after.  The crosswind correction 
is lost and the aircraft drifts.  Reestablish crosswind controls to stop the drift and 
either continue the landing or waveoff, depending on the situation. 
 
g. Landing in a Drift or Crab:  
 
Cause.  Failure to apply sufficient wing-low crosswind corrections. 
 
Effects.  Excessive side loads on landing gear and potential gear damage. 
 
Recovery.  WAVEOFF if unable to apply proper crosswind controls before 
touchdown. 
 
h. Wing Rising After Touchdown: 
 
Cause.  Lift differential combined with rolling moment.  During crosswind landing, 
airflow is greater on the upwind wing because the fuselage reduces airflow over the 
downwind wing.  This causes a lift differential.  The wind also strikes the fuselage on 
the upwind side and this causes a rolling moment about the longitudinal axis, which 
may further assist in raising the upwind wing.  When effects of these two factors are 
great enough, one wing may rise even though directional control is maintained. 
 
Effect.  Depending on the amount of crosswind and degree of corrective action, 
directional control could be lost.  If no correction is applied, one wing can raise 
enough to cause the other wing to strike the ground. 
 
Recovery.  Use ailerons to keep the wings level.  Use rudder to maintain directional 
control.  As the wing rises, the effect increases as more wing area is exposed to the 
crosswind.  
 
612. OUTLYING FIELD DEPARTURE 
 
1. Description.  The outlying field departure (OFD) is a series of uniform procedures by  
which aircraft depart the pattern. 
 
2. General.  Departure from outlying fields shall be conducted in accordance with local  

--- PAGE 147 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SIX 
 
LANDING PROCEDURES    6-33 
course rules.  You are number one for departure when past the departure end of the runway (or as 
defined by local SOP) flaps up, and the aircraft upwind has: 
 
a. Begun his crosswind turn. 
 
b. Raised his gear to depart. 
 
c. Conducted simulated low altitude power loss from the pattern (T-34 only). 
 
NOTE 
 
In order to depart, you do not have to be number one with interval,  
but you must be number one upwind.  There is a difference.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Ensure you are number one upwind. 
 
b. Aircraft shall be safely airborne and past the departure end of the runway (or as 
defined by local SOP) and 120 KIAS minimum. 
 
c. Check airspeed below 150 KIAS. 
 
d. Raise landing gear handle and ensure flaps are up.  Report over ICS, “Gear up, flaps 
up at ____knots.” 
 
e. Add power to MAX.  
 
f. Transmit departure call (see local SOP). 
 
g. Comply with SOP/Course Rules for departure. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Not ensuring you are number one. 
 
b. Forgetting departure call. 
 
c. Not raising gear.  
 
d. A ccelerating above 150 KIAS before raising gear. 
 
e. Not re-trimming. 
 
f. Deviating from course rules.

6-34    LANDING PROCEDURES 
613. VFR WIDE OR STRAIGHT-IN APPROACH 
 
1. Description.  A wide or straight-in approach may be used at either military or civil 
airfields when use of the "break" (or "overhead" at civil fields) would be precluded or 
impractical due to weather, traffic, or local procedures.  These type approaches may also be used 
in conjunction with certain emergencies (i.e., in-flight damage). 
 
2. General.  Every wide or straight-in approach will be different, depending on altitude and 
aircraft position relative to the runway.  These factors may be influenced by weather, traffic, 
approach and/or tower controllers, etc.  The pilot must use his/her judgment and experience to 
adjust the aircraft’s flight path and/or configuration to safely and efficiently execute the approach 
and landing.  
 
Miscellaneous.  It is necessary to become familiar with and understand certain terms used in 
aviation not common to Naval Aviation.  Since the racetrack landing pattern is peculiar to Naval 
Aviation, a pilot may encounter the more common "box" pattern at a non-Navy field or any time 
a non-break entry is made to any field (i.e., visual approach, instrument approach, etc.).  
 
Figure 6-12 illustrates the typical box pattern and its terminology.  Base leg should always be 
referred to as "left base" or "right base," depending on the direction on the turn to final (i.e., a left 
base would mean a left turn to final).  
 
NOTE 
 
There is not an FAA or military standard for the length of the 
"final" leg.  Fly the base leg deep enough so as to allow you to fly 
the aircraft to a 1200-1500 feet straightaway from the threshold at 
150-250 feet AGL.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Establish contact with ATC to communicate your request and/or intentions.  If at a 
tower-controlled field, contact tower when instructed to by Approach Control or prior 
to entering the Airport Traffic Area.  
 
b. Fly the aircraft in an appropriate altitude and airspeed to a position approximately 2-3 
miles from the runway on an extended runway centerline or extended base leg.  
 
c. Transition to the landing approach configuration by slowing below 150 KIAS, 
lowering the landing gear and completing the Before Landing Checklist.  This should 
be done no later than base leg (if used) or a one-mile final.  Lower/hold flaps as 
appropriate.  
 
d. If required, make the appropriate radio call to the tower or RDO.  If at a tower-
controlled field, obtain landing clearance prior to landing and report landing gear 
down and locked.  Check the winds!

CHAPTER SEVEN 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
 
700. INTRODUCTION 
 
This chapter forms the basis of your T-6B Emergency Procedures Training.  A complete and 
thorough knowledge of the procedures in this chapter is essential for students who wish to 
progress to their solo flight.  The memorization and proficient execution of these procedures will 
prove to be one of the greatest challenges to you during Primary Training.  Remember the single 
most important factor in the execution of any emergency procedure is to first maintain control of 
the aircraft.  After the aircraft is under control, you must then determine the precise nature of the 
problem.  It is only at this point that you can execute the applicable emergency procedure and 
determine the appropriate landing criteria.  No matter how well you know your procedures, if 
you lose control of the aircraft or misdiagnose the nature of the malfunction, you will not be 
successful in handling the emergency.  Make sure that you are in control of the aircraft and 
understand what the problem is before you attempt to apply a solution. 
 
1. Description.  N/A 
 
2. General.  It is conceivable that during any flight evolution, an engine or system 
malfunction may occur either while on the ground or in flight.  These malfunctions can range 
from system failures to complete power losses.  All emergencies or malfunctions will be handled 
in accordance with T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual procedures, utilizing CRM skills.  When an 
airborne emergency occurs, three basic rules apply.  These rules should be thoroughly 
understood by all aircrew: 
 
Maintain aircraft control:  Establishing the aircraft in safe controlled flight should always be 
your first priority in any emergency, even if it means consciously continuing in straight and level 
flight.  Conversely, if performing aerobatic maneuvers, for example, and the master caution light 
illuminates, accomplish the appropriate VMC recovery and take care of flying the airplane 
before delving into the specifics of the caution. 
 
Analyze the situation and take proper action:  Analyze the indications you have to determine 
the nature of the emergency.  You should verify what you see in your cockpit with the other 
crewmember.  Once the problem is diagnosed, apply any applicable boldfaced/asterisk items, 
then open your Pocket Checklist and with good aircrew coordination, continue with the 
emergency procedure. 
 
Land as soon as conditions permit:  The severity of the problem will dictate the course of 
action to take to safely recover the aircraft.  Review the definitions for "Land as soon as 
possible" and "Land as soon as practical" in the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual.  Power losses fall 
into two main categories:  
 
a. Those that occur without warning. 
 
b. Those that present ample warning. 

--- PAGE 152 ---
CHAPTER SEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
7-2    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
Impending engine problems may be prefaced by loss of oil pressure, excessive ITT, fluctuating 
N1 or prop RPM, vibrations, etc.  These may be classified as deferred emergencies requiring 
action to prevent catastrophic failure.  This chapter will show the actions to be taken by the pilot 
in the event that the engine fails to operate as designed.  
 
The Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) will be used for both the impending engine failure and 
the immediate power loss.  A different set of procedures will be required to execute a 
Precautionary Emergency Landing (PEL) or Power Loss.  However, the ELP profile will be 
flown for both conditions.  Since precise control of the aircraft and sound judgment are necessary 
to effect a safe landing, a review of factors influencing track over the ground may be in order.  
 
3. Procedures.  Review appropriate emergency procedures.  
 
4. Common Errors.  N/A  
 
701. ABORTED TAKEOFF DEMONSTRATION 
 
1. Description.  This maneuver demonstrates the characteristics and length of runway 
required for an aborted takeoff.  
 
2. General.  An aborted takeoff may be required during any takeoff.  Examples of reasons for 
aborting a takeoff include blown tire(s), streaming fuel, fire light, chip light, fluctuating oil 
pressure, rapidly rising ITT or bird strike.  Any situation which appears abnormal or unsafe 
during takeoff shall necessitate an abort.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Call tower for takeoff, stating intentions.  
 
b. Position aircraft on runway for a normal takeoff.  
 
c. When properly aligned on the runway (and cleared for aborted takeoff), add power to 
30% and check instruments.  
 
d. Release brakes, advance PCL to MAX, and commence normal takeoff roll.  
 
e. Before 1500 feet of takeoff roll and prior to 60 KIAS, initiate the Aborting Takeoff 
procedure as described in the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual.  
 
f. Maneuver is complete when the aircraft has achieved a safe taxi speed.  Taxi clear of 
runway.

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    7-3 
702. EMERGENCY LANDING PATTERN (ELP) 
 
1. Description.  The ELP is a 360° pattern designed to position the aircraft for landing when 
power is not available (Power Loss), or the possibility of a power loss exists or full power is not 
available (Precautionary Emergency Landing [PEL]).  The ELP is used for both actual/simulated 
PEL and actual/simulated Forced Landings.  If altitude permits, intercept the ELP at 3000 feet 
AGL (2500 feet AGL minimum per the T-6B Flight Manual). 
 
2. General.  If an engine failure or malfunction in flight requires a PEL or a forced landing, a 
thorough understanding of T-6 flight performance, emergency procedures, ELP, and ejection 
system capabilities, is critical in the decision to eject or attempt a PEL.  The ELP may be used  
for a fire warning in flight, engine failure, uncommanded power change or loss of power, 
compressor stall, low fuel pressure, chip detector warning, oil system malfunction, 
uncommanded prop feather, bird strike on the propeller, or other unusual engine operation.  If 
there is any doubt about engine performance, or there is benefit to remaining in the ejection 
envelope longer, consider recovering using the ELP.  The time available to decide whether to 
recover via ELP or eject depends on the phase of flight.  Time available can range from a few 
seconds to over 20 minutes for a high-altitude power loss.  ELPs are only flown to suitable 
landing areas (hard surface runway, taxiway, under run, or overrun) of sufficient length.  
Landing on an unprepared surface should only be attempted if ejection is not possible. 
 
In an actual engine failure scenario, the methodology to descend below the minimum controlled 
ejection altitude employs a series of critical decisions.  With an actual failed engine, T-6B 
aircrews will not descend below 2000 feet AGL unless they are on profile for a field, with the 
runway in sight and in a position to safely maneuver to land.  Do not delay the decision to eject 
in an unlikely attempt to land on an off duty runway if engine failure occurs while configured in 
the normal landing pattern. 
 
Distractions resulting from excessive troubleshooting or time-consuming attempts to regain 
power during the execution of the ELP may cause substantial deviation from the standard 
pattern, precluding a safe landing at the selected site.  
 
ELP Types.  The depicted profile (Figure 7-2) is used for both a power loss and a PEL.  The 
difference between a power loss and a PEL is power available.  The power loss is flown with the 
engine inoperative (no power) and the PEL is flown with power available, although engine 
failure may be imminent or power available may be less than normal.  If flown correctly, the 
power loss and PEL look the same.  However, methods to correct for low energy states differ.  
For a power loss, correct for low energy by delaying landing gear or flap extension, intercepting 
the ELP at some point other than high key (low key, base key, final), and/or adjusting pattern 
ground track.  For a PEL, immediately use power to correct for a low energy state as soon as it is 
recognized and do not delay configuration. 
 
In a power loss situation, the only way to dissipate excess energy is by early configuration of 
gear/flaps.  In a PEL, extra drag can be induced by use of zero torque or by use of the speed 
brake.  IPs will simulate a feathered prop by setting power to 4-6% torque. 
 

--- PAGE 154 ---
CHAPTER SEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
7-4    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
ELP Descent to High Key.  Turn immediately to the nearest suitable field based on aircraft 
condition, weather, airfield conditions, altitude, and gliding distance available.  In most PEL 
situations (chip light, low oil pressure, etc.), time is the most critical element.  The longer the 
engine runs, the greater the chance for complete failure.  For this reason, every effort should be 
made to expedite getting to high key with power.  Don’t turn a PEL into power loss due to slow 
procedures or excessive troubleshooting! 
 
In the event of engine malfunction or failure, there may be more than one airfield within glide 
distance.  Select the most suitable airfield based on the following factors: 
 
1. Distance to airfield. 
 
2. Terrain around airfield. 
 
3. Runway length, width, direction, and condition. 
 
4. Weather. 
 
5. Fire or rescue support. 
 
6. Emergency oxygen and electrical power supply.  Time required for glide from high altitude 
with engine inoperative may exceed emergency oxygen supply. 
 
7. Threat to the public if aircraft must be abandoned/ejection . 
 
Choosing the Most Suitable Field.  In a PEL situation, time is the most critical element since a 
degraded engine may stop providing useful power at any time.  Choose the closest hard-surface 
field with a minimum of a 3000’ runway to set up for the ELP.  If multiple fields meet this 
criteria, other considerations such as crash crew support or medical assistance may be factored 
in. 
 
Distance Calculations.  A VFR chart, conventional NAVAIDS, and FMS can be used 
when judging distance to the selected recovery airfield.  The NRST function on the FMS is 
extremely helpful in providing accurate distance information.  Two primary methods used 
to determine energy state relative to emergency fields are: 
 
a. DME Method.  Compare energy state relative to a specific field.  A memory aid for 
this method is “1/2 DME + KEY.” 
 
i. Determine distance to field (FMS NRST function). 
 
ii. Distance divided by 2 = minimum AGL altitude required. 
 
iii. Is altitude (AGL) sufficient to reach the field? 
 
iv. Add 3,000 feet (high key) or 1,500 feet (low key) to AGL altitude required. 

--- PAGE 155 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SEVEN 
 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    7-5 
v. Is energy sufficient to reach high or low key? 
 
b. Altitude Method.  Compare energy state relative to more than one field. 
 
i. Subtract 3000 foot (high key) or 1500 foot (low key) from AGL altitude; 
multiply by 2 to determine maximum glide distance to high or low key. 
 
ii. Identify fields within glide distance to high or low key.  Determine most 
suitable field. 
 
Energy Management:  Normally the ELP will be entered at high key, but the ELP can be 
intercepted at any point on the ELP profile between high key and final.  Carefully manage 
energy to arrive at high key on altitude and airspeed.  Attempt to dissipate excess energy 
prior to high key to minimize disorientation and allow the profile to be flown normally.  If 
excess altitude exists during the glide to high key, lose energy by executing:  360° turns, 
bow ties, S-turns, slips, lower the gear early, or use a combination of these methods.  The 
amount of rudder deflection used in a slip should be commensurate with the desired 
altitude loss.  In a PEL situation, expeditiously maneuver towards high key while 
simultaneously dissipating energy as needed.  All of these methods may be used for both 
PEL and power loss at pilot’s discretion. 
 
NOTE 
 
Slipping with a known engine/oil malfunction could result in 
impaired windscreen visibility due to oil leakage spraying onto the 
windshield. 
 
a. 360° turns prior to high key (PEL or power loss).  This is generally accomplished 
very near or directly over the intended landing destination.  If excessive time is spent 
dissipating energy, the engine may fail at any time without warning.  Approximate 
altitude loss for 360° turns: 
 
125 KIAS, Idle power: 
 
 30° bank - 3000-3500 feet. 
 
125 KIAS, 4-6% torque or prop feathered: 
 
30° bank - 2,000 feet. 
 
45° bank - 1,500 feet. 
 
60° bank - 1,000 feet. 
 
 

--- PAGE 156 ---
CHAPTER SEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
7-6    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
b. Bow Ties.  Bow Ties are essentially a continuous set of mild turns in the shape of a 
bow tie flown approximately ½ wing tip distance (WTD) away and on the downwind 
side of the landing area.  With each bow tie, you should attempt to keep the landing 
runway in sight.  Bow ties are not precise maneuvers and different techniques exist on 
how to fly them.  Your instructor will provide guidance; however, plan to depart the 
bow ties for high key with sufficient altitude remaining to glide to high key altitude. 
 
c. S-turns.  S-turns are used to affect a milder altitude loss and may be specifically used 
to make controlled corrections while proceeding direct to high key.  Designed to 
increase the actual track over the ground, S-turns are simply lazy turns back and forth 
deviating from a straight-line ground track in order to provide more time to descend. 
 
Glide Performance.  A clean glide at 125 KIAS approximates best glide range.  For no-wind 
planning, a clean aircraft (prop feathered or 4-6% torque set) at 125 KIAS should glide 2 nautical 
miles for every 1,000 feet of altitude lost, with a VSI of approximately 1350-1500 fpm. 
 
a. In an actual PEL situation, check the descent rate after setting 4-6% torque (clean 
configuration).  If VSI is greater than 1,500 fpm, increase torque to achieve a 1,350 
fpm descent.  If power is insufficient to achieve a descent rate less than 1,500 fpm, 
consider shutting down the engine to improve glide performance. 
 
b. If time permits, use DME or FMS to confirm the actual glide ratio.  Consider winds 
and required turns.  Adjust the plan if actual glide distance varies from expected. 
 
c. If unable to climb or zoom, the ai rcraft travels approximately 0.1 to 0.2 nautical miles 
of horizontal distance for every 10 knots of excess airspeed above 125 KIAS in a 
level deceleration.  For example, at 200 KIAS the aircraft glides approximately 1.2 
NM straight and level before slowing to 125 KIAS. 
 
d. At optimum glide airspeeds, the drag of extended landing gear reduces the glide ratio 
(NM flown to 1000’s of feet of altitude loss) from 2:1 to1.5:1. 
 
e. Ten knots of extra airspeed can be traded for approximately 100 feet of increased 
altitude.  For example, 175 KIAS and 6,000 feet is approximately the same energy 
level as 125 KIAS and 6,500 feet.  Once on ELP profile, reduce power to 4-6% 
torque and maintain altitude as the airspeed bleeds off to 125 KIAS. 
 
Airspeed.  Maintain 125 KIAS minimum clean or 120 KIAS minimum with landing gear 
extended.  To expedite descent to high key in the event of a PEL/PPEL, students may accelerate 
above 125 KIAS with idle power/speed brakes as required to increase rate of descent.

aircraft for landing from a PEL, PEL from the pattern [PEL(P)] or power loss.  See Figure 7-1 
and Figure 7-2.  For a power loss, correct for low energy by delaying landing gear or flap 
extension, intercepting the ELP at some point other than high key (low key, base key, final), 
and/or adjusting the pattern ground track.  For a PEL or PEL(P), do not delay configuration.  Use 
immediate power (as required) to correct for low energy as soon as its recognized.  Reduce PCL 
to idle when landing is assured.

a. Planning.  The primary reference during an ELP is the runway.  Crosscheck energy 
level (altitude + airspeed) with position.  Look outside to maintain proper ground 
track.  Predict energy level (altitude +airspeed) as early as possible at known 
reference points (high key, low key and base key) and anticipate required corrections. 
Position deviations can occur due to poor planning, imprecise aircraft control, or 
improper wind analysis.  Trim throughout the ELP to minimize airspeed deviations. 
Make all corrections smooth and expeditious to avoid stall. 
 
b. High Key.  Position the aircraft at high key, 2500-3000 feet AGL, 120 KIAS, gear 
down, wings level, aligned with the landing direction and approximately one-quarter 
WTD from the runway away from the intended ELP turn direction.  Turn, using angle 
of bank as necessary (~ 15-20° in calm wind), towards the low key position.  
Maintain 120 KIAS and make appropriate voice call. 

--- PAGE 159 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SEVEN 
 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    7-9 
c. Low Key.  Located approximately two-thirds WTD (fuel cap on runway), abeam the 
intended point of landing (no wind), altitude approximately 1,500 feet AGL and 120 
KIAS minimum.  
 
i. Approaching low key, crosscheck the runway to evaluate spacing.  Check winds 
on PFD and crosscheck with windsock.  Plan final approach accordingly. 
 
ii. At low key, level the wings momentarily and check for proper spacing and 
altitude.  If energy is assessed to be adequate to make the runway, lower TO 
flaps (lower flaps no sooner than low key). 
 
NOTE 
 
Delaying TO Flaps because of low energy could potentially result 
in slow final turn airspeed during a power loss.  Use caution and do 
not slow below 120 KIAS in the final turn.  Do not delay the 
decision to Eject (actual engine failure) or waveoff (simulated 
engine failure) after determining a safe landing is unlikely. 
 
If the aircraft is below profile between high key and low key, add 
power to regain altitude (if available).  MAX power may not 
always be appropriate depending on the amount of correction 
required.  After base key, use normal power corrections to ensure a 
safe and controlled landing.  
 
A slip may be used to dissipate energy.  Use caution slipping when 
configured and close to the ground.  The slip must be taken out 
carefully with enough altitude remaining (200-300 feet) to slow the 
rate of descent and ensure positive control of the aircraft during the 
final moments of the maneuver. 
 
d. Base Key.  Maintain 120 KIAS minimum.  The descent is normally greater than for a 
normal pattern.  Fly the aircraft perpendicular to the runway (base key) at 600-800 
feet AGL.  Altitude is not the only indication of proper energy management; the 
distance from the runway must also be assessed and the effect of winds taken into 
account.  When landing is assured, flaps may be lowered to LDG. 
 
e. Final.  Aircraft may be slowed to 110 KIAS (minimum) on final.  Maintain 110 
KIAS (minimum) on final until transition to landing.  The transition to landing may 
begin well prior to the intended point of touch down.  Plan to land within the first 
one-third of the runway. 
 
NOTE 
 
Use caution with low power settings on final, especially with LDG 
flaps.  High descent rate with idle power setting, coupled with 

--- PAGE 160 ---
CHAPTER SEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
7-10    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
pitch change to intercept a normal glide path, could result in rapid 
decrease in airspeed.  A high sink rate can develop, which may 
result in a stall or hard landing. 
 
f. Landing.  Adjust the nose attitude in the flare to transition to a normal landing.  
Touch down on the main gear and then gently lower the nose wheel as in a normal 
landing.  Apply braking as needed based on runway remaining. 
 
i. PEL.  Reduce power to IDLE when landing is assured.  If runway remaining 
after touchdown is insufficient to stop, waveoff.  If sufficient power is available 
to obtain low key, attempt a PEL(P).  If power is insufficient or engine failure 
occurs, consider ejection. 
 
ii. Power Loss.  Anticipate a longer flare and touch down due to reduced drag. 
Use caution when applying brakes to prevent blown tires.  If the aircraft cannot 
be stopped before the end of the runway, execute the Aircraft Departs Prepared 
Surface Procedure or Eject. 
 
5. ELP Wind Analysis.  Winds can cause ELPs to differ significantly from standard.  An 
uncorrected/unanticipated strong wind component can result in an unsuccessful ELP, even if it 
was otherwise flown flawlessly. 
 
Determining Winds.  Surface winds, winds at 1,000 to 3,000 feet, winds at 5,000 feet and 
winds aloft should be obtained from weather forecasts and serve as a good starting point for 
building situational awareness about actual wind conditions.  The winds at 1,000 to 3,000 
feet can vary significantly from surface winds and significantly alter required ELP ground 
track.  At tower controlled runways, actual surface winds are known.  Other methods to 
determine the winds include: 
 
i. Radio calls to other aircraft, a fixed base operator (FBO) on the field, ASOS , 
etc. 
 
ii. Without access to actual observations, use winds briefed by weather forecaster 
in the preflight briefing as a starting assumption. 
 
iii. If performing an ELP at a non- towered airfield (NTA) without weather 
observation capability, assume that in the local area, surface winds will be 
similar to those at the home field. 
 
iv. Observation of surface conditions; smoke, waves on lakes, wind tetrahedron, 
windsock, etc. 
 
v. Double the surface wind velocity to estimate winds at high key as wind is 
typically stronger at altitude than at the surface. 
 
vi. Use PFD indications of wind speed and direction.

703. PRECAUTIONARY EMERGENCY LANDING (PEL) 
 
1. Description.  Use the PEL procedure to ensure that a safe landing at a paved field can be 
made if indications of an impending engine failure should occur.  A PEL will be performed any 
time engine reliability is questionable or there are indications of impending engine failure. 
 
2. General.  During a practice PEL, the instructor will initiate the procedure by informing the 
student of a simulated condition requiring that a PEL be performed.  Indications of an impending 
failure or power loss could be excessive vibration, smoke or fumes, chip detector annunciator 
light, fuel or propeller malfunction or any other condition listed in the T-6B NATOPS Flight 
Manual requiring that you land as soon as possible. 
 
Initial Actions.  Initial reaction to an engine related malfunction at low altitude should be 
to trade excess airspeed for altitude.  If at high altitude, begin an immediate and expeditious 
descent towards high key altitude.  If a climb is needed, climb at 140 KIAS (best rate).  Use 
maximum power of 100% if the emergency is not related to the oil system or strong engine 
vibrations.  If it is oil related, use minimum power as necessary to intercept the ELP and 
avoid unnecessary PCL movements.  Once altitude is sufficient to make high key, reduce 
power to 4-6% torque and trim for a 125 KIAS (minimum) descent.  When climbing, do 
not lose situational awareness or visual contact (if acquired) with the intended landing 
runway.  When determining altitude required for ELP, be sure to account for winds and 
required turns. 
 
NOTE 
 
For practice PEL training, determine the landing runway at your 
intended landing site before intercepting the ELP profile.  Deliver 
a simulated voice report over the ICS to the instructor.  The voice 
report should include the aircraft Identification, Situation, Position 
and Intentions (ISPI format).  In a real emergency, consider using 
guard frequency or communicating to the RDO as required. 
 
The instructor will make the appropriate radio call to enter the 
outlying field as required by local SOP. 
 
The PEL checklist in the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual offers an organized approach to recovery 
with an engine malfunction, and some of the steps are equally useful for an engine failure in 
flight.  A good memory aid for these steps (PEL checklist); “Turn, Climb, Clean, Check, BIP.” 
 
3. Procedures.  The first four steps, “Turn, Climb, Clean, Check,” must be executed nearly 
simultaneously and without delay. 
 
a. TURN.  Turn in the general direction toward the nearest suitable field.  Locate the 
field visually, use conventional NAVAIDS or FMS NRST to aid in determining 
nearest field. 
 

--- PAGE 162 ---
CHAPTER SEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
7-12    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
b. CLIMB or ACCELERATE.  If a climb is needed, climb at 140 KIAS using an 
appropriate power setting to achieve Dead Engine Glide Distance (DEGA).  If unable 
to climb due to clouds, icing, etc., increase energy by accelerating to a higher 
airspeed.  Remain clear of clouds until in position to descend and/or decelerate to 
enter the ELP.  If at high altitude, a descent will be required to enter the ELP. 
 
c. CLEAN.  Ensure aircraft is in a clean configuration by raising landing gear, flaps, 
and speed brake (as appropriate for the emergency) as soon as possible.  Retraction 
may not be possible if the engine fails.  Remember that excess drag inhibits the climb 
and greatly reduces gliding range.  
 
d. CHECK.  Check the engine instruments, analyze the situation and determine the 
nature of the emergency.  Next, take the proper action by accomplishing the 
appropriate checklist procedures, then continue with the PEL checklist. 
 
NOTE 
 
During a practice PEL, students will state the actual applicable 
engine indications which may include Torque, N
p, Oil Pressure, 
ITT, and N1.  The instructor will then give simulated engine 
indications and any EICAS messages that may apply.  The student 
will then determine the cause of the emergency and simulate 
applying appropriate checklist procedures. 
 
e. BIP (Boost Pump, Ignition Switch, Plan). 
 
Boost Pump and Ignition Switch (as required).  Turn boost pump and ignition 
switches on unless an Airstart would not be warranted should the engine fail (oil 
system malfunction, chip light, fire light or FOD).  Refer to NATOPS PCL time 
permitting. 
 
f. Plan:  The above considerations and energy state should lead to one of three 
decisions: 
 
i. Intercept the ELP profile at or above high key. 
 
ii. Intercept the ELP profile at a point other than high key with the appropriate 
configuration and airspeed. 
 
iii. Eject if it becomes clear that the aircraft cannot be safely recovered. 
 
g. Determine the duty runway at your landing site. 
 
h. Deliver a simulated voice report using ISPI format over ICS to the instructor. 
 
i. Approaching high key, assess the winds and plan accordingly.

j. Lower the landing gear no later than high key.  
 
k. Accomplish the Before Landing Checklist once the gear is lowered. 
 
l. At high key, turn toward the low key position using angle of bank as required to 
maintain ground track and make the appropriate radio call in accordance with local 
SOP.  Maintain 120 KIAS. 
 
m. Approaching low key, vary the angle of bank as necessary so as to arrive at a 2/3 
wingtip distance abeam the intended point of landing.  Level the wings momentarily 
to accurately check your position abeam.  
 
n. At low key, set TO flaps and perform the low key voice report IAW local SOP.  
Lower flaps no sooner than low key.  Use power as required to maintain energy state 
inside of the low key position. 
 
o. Continue the turn towards the base key position.  Vary angle of bank as necessary to 
arrive at a proper base key position (600-800 feet AGL, 120 KIAS).  
 
p. Check and report, “Gear down, flaps TO (or LDG as required), speed  brake retracted, 
Landing Checklist complete.” 
 
q. Decelerate toward 110 KIAS after rolling out on final.  Maintain 110 KIAS on final 
until commencing the landing transition.  Make an ICS call IAW local SOP. 
 
r. Reduce power to idle when landing is assured.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Delaying turn toward the nearest suitable field during initial climb. 
 
b. Excessive climb.  Delayed arrival at high key, increased risk of engine failure during 
PEL. 
 
c. Improper analysis/response to the emergency. 
 
d. Improper position at high key (aircraft not aligned). 
 
e. Poor power control on PEL.  Failure to set and maintain 4-6% torque once on ELP 
profile. 
 
f. Excessive or insufficient bank angle at high key resulting in improper l ow key 
spacing. 
 
g. Delaying configuration (gear/flaps) instead of correcting with power.

j. Failure to anticipate or correct for wind. 
 
k. Failure to reduce power to idle during landing phase of PEL. 
 
l. Failure to refer to NATOPS Pocket Checklist (time permitting). 
 
704. POWER LOSS  
 
1. Description.  A Power Loss may occur at any airspeed, altitude or configuration.  Fly 
(glide) to intercept the ELP profile while simultaneously executing the appropriate procedures.  
Identify the nearest suitable airfield and safely maneuver the aircraft to intercept the ELP.  Arrive 
at high key aligned with the landing runway.  If high key cannot be reached, intercept profile at 
some point on the ELP (low key, base key, final).  Below 2000 feet AGL, make a timely decision 
to continue or eject. 
 
2. General.  A power loss may be caused by engine seizure, flameout, or malfunction of the 
PMU (Power Management Unit).  Carefully manage your energy state to arrive at high key on or 
slightly above altitude.  Do not unnecessarily dissipate energy quickly with a failed engine.  Use 
the extra time to formulate a plan that will maximize the possibility for success. 
 
Initial indications of an engine failure/flameout are:  loss of power and airspeed, rapid decay in 
N
1, torque, and ITT, and propeller moving toward feather due to loss of oil pressure.  The GEN, 
FUEL PX, and OIL PX warning will illuminate, followed by the OBOGS fail warning.  The 
PMU FAIL and CKPT PX warning may illuminate. 
 
Initial Actions.  Initial reaction to a power loss should be to zoom glide (trade excess airspeed 
for altitude) or glide towards 125 KIAS in accordance with applicable emergency procedures.  
Zoom capability at 200 KIAS will vary from approximately 600-900 feet.  At higher altitudes, 
the requirement to zoom or simply decelerate to glide speed is based on distance to the selected 
recovery field.  For a practice power loss situation, set 4-6% to simulate a feathered prop torque, 
and trim for a 125 KIAS (minimum) descent.  When determining DEGA to a suitable field, be 
sure to account for winds when gliding to high key.  The first four steps of the Engine Failure 
during flight in the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual offers an organized approach to recovery with 
an engine failure in flight.  Once accomplished, you will then need to decide whether to use the 
ELP to recover, or eject if no suitable site is within DEGA. 
 
3. Procedures.  The first four steps must be executed without delay.  After determining the 
nature of the emergency, accomplish any applicable Immediate Action Items (Asterisk Items), 
and then continue with the power loss as required. 
 
a. ZOOM/GLIDE - 125 KIAS (MINIMUM).  Above 150 KIAS zoom to capture 125 
KIAS minimum.  Below 150 KIAS slow to 125 KIAS minimum as required.  At high 

--- PAGE 165 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SEVEN 
 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    7-15 
altitudes, smoothly decelerate to the 125 KIAS descent attitude to trade excess 
airspeed for glide distance. 
 
NOTE 
 
A simulated power loss will usually begin the instructor pulling the 
PCL to idle and stating “simulated.”  Students will state the actual 
applicable engine indications which may include Torque, N
p, Oil 
Pressure, ITT, and N1.  The instructor will then give simulated 
engine indications and any EICAS messages that may apply.  The 
student will then determine the cause of the emergency and 
simulate applying appropriate checklist procedures. 
 
b. PCL - OFF (IP will simulate PCL off by setting 4-6% torque). 
 
c. INTERCEPT ELP.  As you are accomplishing steps one and two, begin turning 
towards the nearest field.  Raise landing gear, flaps and speed brake as soon as 
possible as retraction may not be possible as the engine spools down.  Check the 
engine instruments and analyze the situation.  Crosscheck N
1 against other engine 
indications to assess condition of engine and determine if an airstart is warranted.  If 
the engine has completely failed, the N
1 will indicate 0% within 5 seconds depending 
on airspeed.  Torque will be indicating 0%.  
 
d. Airstart.  Attempt if warranted. 
 
If conditions do not warrant an airstart. 
 
e. FIREWALL SHUTOFF handle – Pull. 
 
f. Execute Forced Landing or Eject. 
 
Eject if at or below 2000 feet and not on an ELP profile in a safe position to land. 
 
g. For practice power loss training, determine the landing runway at your intended 
landing site while maneuvering to intercept the ELP profile.  Deliver a simulated 
voice report over the ICS to the instructor.  Include the aircraft Identification, 
Situation, Position and Intentions (ISPI).  During an actual emergency, consider using 
guard frequency or communicating with the RDO as required. 
 
h. Approaching high key, assess the winds and plan accordingly. 
 
i. Intercept the ELP profile at or above high key.  
 
j. If unable to intercept high key, intercept the ELP profile at another point with the 
appropriate configuration and airspeed.

k. Lower the landing gear as required for energy state.  Accomplish the Before Landing 
Checklist.  
 
l. At high key, turn toward the low key position using angle of bank as required and 
make the appropriate radio call (see local SOP).  Maintain 120 KIAS. 
 
m. Approaching low key, vary the angle of bank as necessary so as to arrive at a 2/3 
wingtip distance abeam the intended point of landing.  Level the wings momentarily 
to check your position abeam. 
 
n. At low key, set TO flaps (if on profile) and perform the low key voice report (see 
local SOP).  Lower flaps no sooner than low key.  If flaps are delayed because of low 
energy state, use caution in the final turn because of increased stall speed.  Do not 
slow below 120 KIAS. 
 
o. Assess energy state approaching the base key position and determine if a safe landing 
can be made.  If a safe landing is unlikely, EJECT (actual engine failure) or 
WAVEOFF (simulated engine failure).  
 
p. Continue the turn towards the base key position.  Vary angle of bank as necessary to 
arrive at a proper base key position (600-800 feet AGL, 120 KIAS).  
 
q. Check and report, “Gear down, flaps TO (or LDG as required), speed  brake retracted, 
Landing Checklist complete.” 
 
r. Decelerate toward 110 KIAS after rolling out on final.  Maintain 110 KIAS on final 
until commencing the landing transition.  Make an ICS call IAW local SOP. 
 
s. Unless directed by the IP, power will remain at 4-6% throughout the flare to simulate 
a feathered prop.  Anticipate longer flare and touchdown due to decreased drag.  If 
touchdown will occur past the first 1/3 of the runway, WAVEOFF.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Delay of turn toward the nearest suitable field during initial climb. 
 
b. Improper position at high key (aircraft not aligned). 
 
c. Excessive or insufficient bank angle at high key resulting in improper low key 
spacing. 
 
d. Premature configuration.  For example, TO flaps lowered at low key with insufficient 
energy on profile. 
 
e. Poor airspeed control/poor trim.

705. PRECAUTIONARY EMERGENCY LANDING FROM THE PATTERN 
 
1. Description.  Use PEL procedures if indications of an impending engine failure occur 
while in the landing pattern. 
 
2. General.  The same indications of an impending engine failure as discussed in the PPEL 
may occur in the landing pattern.  This maneuver affords the opportunity for the student to 
practice intercepting the ELP at low key while already established in the landing pattern.  
 
The PPEL in the pattern will be initiated at or above 500 feet AGL by the instructor informing 
the student that he has a simulated condition requiring that a practice PPEL(P) be performed.   
 
NOTE 
 
This simulated PEL should not be initiated until proper interval 
with both PPEL(P) and touch-and-go traffic is obtained.  
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. TURN towards the nearest suitable runway.  Consider the use of an off-duty runway.  
If the pattern is extended and/or the winds are calm, the nearest suitable runway may 
be the reciprocal of the runway the aircraft just departed.  The instructor will then 
direct which runway will be used.  Practice PELs in the pattern must conform with 
local course rules.  The instructor will make the appropriate call to the 
Tower/RDO/crash crew. 
 
b. CLIMB at 125 KIAS, utilizing power setting as appropriate for the simulated 
emergency.  
 
NOTE 
 
Anticipate immediate forward stick to maintain 125 KIAS should 
total engine power be lost.  
 
c. CLEAN up the aircraft, gear and flaps – UP.  Report "aircraft clean" to your 
instructor.  
 
d. CHECK Aircraft and engine instruments.  Conduct a systematic check of the aircraft 
for secondary indications.  
 
e. DETERMINE Verify the intended runway with the instructor.

7-18    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
f. DELIVER the appropriate simulated radio report to your instructor.  For an actual 
emergency, notify the tower/RDO of your situation/intentions on the radio.  
 
g. Continue the climb until within dead engine gliding distance of a low key position; 
then REDUCE power to 4-6%, lower the nose to the 125 KIAS glide attitude and re-
trim. 
 
h. LOWER the landing gear, REPORT the Before Landing Checklist and re-trim for 
120 KIAS. 
 
i. Arrive at pattern low key with proper configuration, altitude, and ⅔ wingtip distance. 
 
j. Make the appropriate radio call at pattern low key.  
 
k. Complete the maneuver as in the last half of the PEL. 
 
NOTE 
 
Any time the aircraft is below profile, add power as required to 
regain proper altitude/airspeed.  After the base key position, use 
momentary power as required to regain profile.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Not maintaining 125 KIAS in the climb.  
 
b. Failure to use power when low throughout the pattern.  
 
c. Over climbing to low key, resulting in excessive altitude precluding a safe descent 
profile to landing. 
 
d. Failure to complete the Before Landing Checklist prior to low key.  
 
706. EMERGENCY VOICE REPORTS 
 
Emergency voice reports will be made in the IDENTIFICATION, SITUATION, POSITION, 
AND INTENTION (ISPI) format. 
 
In a non-radar environment, emergency reports of an immediate or serious nature are preceded 
by the word "MAYDAY."  Repeating MAYDAY three times is the widely accepted method of 
clearing the frequency for an emergency voice report.  An example of an emergency voice report 
of an engine failure in a non-radar environment is as follows: 
 
"MAYDAY! MAYDAY! MAYDAY! [Call sign], engine failure, seven miles northeast of 
Brewton at 9500 feet.  Intend to land in at Brewton OLF." 
 

--- PAGE 169 ---

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    7-19 
In a radar environment, standard procedure for a distressed or urgent situation is to declare an 
emergency.  An example of an emergency voice report of an engine failure in a radar 
environment is as follows: 
 
"[Call sign] is declaring an emergency.  Chip Light, 10 miles north of Corpus at 5000 feet.  
Executing emergency landing at T. P. McCampbell." 
 
Regardless of radar condition, expect to inform ATC of fuel remaining in hours and minutes 
(i.e., 1+00) and the number of people on board after delivery of ISPI information.

SOLO FLIGHT    8-1 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
SOLO FLIGHT 
 
800. INTRODUCTION 
 
For most students, the First Safe for Solo Checkride will be the most demanding task undertaken 
to date in their aviation career.  While the safe-for-solo check is certainly challenging, successful 
completion is a rewarding, confidence-building experience.  
 
801. THE SOLO FLIGHT 
 
1. Preflight Preparation 
 
a. Physical preparation.  Make sure your body is well rested.  The average sleep 
requirement is eight hours during each 24-hour period.  However, needs will vary 
with each individual.  Lack of sleep means a lack of awareness.  You should have 
learned your procedures throughout your training so do not try to "cram" the night 
before your flight.  Get a good night’s rest.  If you have received your training 
properly, all that is necessary to prepare for the check flight is a review.  Make sure 
that your body is well nourished.  If you eat a well-balanced diet regularly, you will 
have a sufficient energy supply.  Do not depend on a coffee and donut breakfast, or a 
coke and candy bar lunch.  As always, avoid self-medication, and if you are sick, do 
not hesitate to see the flight surgeon.  If you are ill, you do not belong in a cockpit. 
 
b. Mental Preparation.  You must know your Standard Operating and Emergency 
Procedures before the flight.  Since you have passed your check flight, you have 
demonstrated that you can safely operate the aircraft without assistance.  However, 
you must be even more prepared for the solo, as there will not be an instructor to bail 
you out of critical situations.  Study those procedures, especially those requiring 
immediate action.  Prior to the solo, plan your flight in order to make efficient use of 
the limited time available.  Review the course rules for the area in which you plan to 
operate.  Pay particular attention to location of airfields that may be used in the event 
of an emergency.  You should also ensure that you have the proper flight equipment  
and checklists in your possession.  Prior to leaving the Flight Duty Officer’s (FDO) 
desk, you should find out which OLF’s are available for solo operations, their status 
and operating hours.  Ask the FDO if he has any information that may pertain to your 
flight.  And if you have any final questions, do not hesitate to ask. 
 
c. Ground Procedures.  You will be assigned an aircraft for which you are solely 
responsible after signing the "A" sheet.  Inspect all the gripes on the aircraft carefully. 
Once again, if you have any questions, do not be afraid to ask.  Take note of any 
repeat gripes of a serious nature.  Do not accept the aircraft for flight if there are any 
outstanding gripes which must be corrected. 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 172 ---
CHAPTER EIGHT PRIMARY CONTACT 
8-2    SOLO FLIGHT 
d. Preflight.  Conduct a thorough and complete preflight.  If you note any discrepancies, 
call a troubleshooter.  Do not just ask a lineman.  He is not qualified to make any 
judgments as to airworthiness.  If any doubt exists, check with a flight instructor.  
 
e. Securing the rear cockpit.  Ensure the rear cockpit is secured for solo flight in 
accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual.  Again, if you have any 
questions, ask an instructor or call for a qualified maintenance person to assist.  
 
f. Start, taxi, and checks.  It is recommended that you read the checklists out loud as if 
your instructor were with you.  This will reduce your chances of omitting an item on 
the checklist.  While taxiing, keep your head "on a swivel."  You are solely 
responsible for the safety of the aircraft and a good "See-and-Avoid" doctrine is 
imperative, both on the ground and in the air.  You also need to pay attention to radio 
transmissions, especially those that begin with your call sign.  If problems should 
arise, do not hesitate to ask the FDO for assistance.  You should know the areas 
available for maintenance hot spots for minor repairs if needed.  
 
2. Takeoff and Flight.  Prior to taking the active runway, ensure you have clearance to do so.  
Read back the appropriate response as required.  Even before this, you should have already 
thought out the Takeoff and Departure procedures to ensure a smooth evolution.  
 
a. Restrictions.  You may not make a full-stop landing at an OLF unless directed by the 
RDO, or if weather or an emergency makes it necessary.  If you must make a full-stop 
landing at an OLF, remember that you are responsible for the aircraft until either you 
return it to home field, or you are relieved of responsibility by a maintenance or 
instructor pilot.  Perform Before Leaving the Aircraft checklist.  Once you have 
properly taken care of your aircraft, call the FDO and advise him of your situation.  
Be sure to use a fireguard for restarting the aircraft. 
 
Solos may not practice spins, stalls, simulated engine failures, PPELs, or any 
maneuver which has not been previously introduced.  Solo launch time is no earlier 
than sunrise with an RDO on station.  Solo recovery is no later than 30 minutes prior 
to official sunset. 
 
b. High work.  Conform to local course rules and remain oriented.  Check between 
maneuvers to see where you are in the working area.  You should be monitoring the 
area common frequency, as well as the guard frequency in the event of a solo recall.  
Take time to practice maneuvers which you need to perfect.  Keep your scan moving 
outside for other aircraft in the same operating area. 
 
c. Operations at Outlying Fields.  Ensure that you know the radio frequency and 
pattern altitude of the OLF you are about to enter.  Utilize the proper entry and 
communications procedures for the OLF.  Know the proper pattern direction and use 
extra care in establishing interval.  You should also keep track of your flight time and 
number of landings accomplished at the OLF.  When it is time to depart, follow 
applicable course rules and check your gear and flaps are in the “up” position. 

--- PAGE 173 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER EIGHT 
 
SOLO FLIGHT    8-3 
d. Emergencies.  In all emergencies, the first consideration is to fly the aircraft.  Then, 
determine the situation and your course of action in accordance with the T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual.  When time permits, communicate and let others know your 
situation.  
 
i. Lost aircraft.  If you get lost, admit it and try to communicate using all 
available channels and navigation aids including the nearest function on the 
Flight Management System (FMS).  Land at a suitable airfield before you run 
out of gas.  The best policy is to remain oriented and do not get lost.  If you 
actually get lost, it will be necessary for you to use your own initiative and good 
judgment.  Every situation will be different; therefore, it is impossible to 
establish a criterion that will apply to every set of circumstances.  However, the 
following items, known as the five "Cs" will generally apply:  CONFESS, 
CLIMB, COMMUNICATE, CONSERVE, AND COMPLY.  
 
(a) CONFESS - Admit that your are lost and need some form of assistance.  
 
(b) CLIMB - Ceiling and visibility permitting, climb to improve radio 
reception and forward visibility.  
 
(c) COMMUNICATE - Request assistance on the area working frequency 
from an instructor pilot or advice from your FDO.  If unable, try calling 
Approach Control  and request vectors to home field.  If you get no reply, 
switch to GUARD and try again.  
 
If ATC replies, they will ask you to squawk a certain code on your 
transponder.  They may also ask you to provide other information in order 
to give you a vector (heading) to home field.  If it appears that clouds will 
be on your vectored flight path, advise Approach and circle while 
maintaining VFR.  
 
(d) CONSERVE - Operate the aircraft (when straight and level) at maximum 
endurance AOA of 8.8 units.  
 
(e) COMPLY - With instructions received from another dual aircraft, ATC, 
or your base.  Many prominent landmarks are available in and around your 
working areas, they may give clues as to your general whereabouts.  If you 
find yourself lost, the important thing to remember is this:  Do not fly 
about aimlessly.  Be calm and develop a plan using your good judgment 
and established procedures.  If you still cannot identify your position after 
having gone through the five "Cs," look for any established landing field.  
Before landing at a strange field, circle it at a safe altitude and locate all 
obstacles and hazards.  Determine the wind direction and duty runway and 
try to get a rough estimation of runway length and width.  If there is a 
tower at the field, try to contact Approach or Tower on GUARD prior to 
landing.  Once you are ready to land, make a normal traffic pattern.  

--- PAGE 174 ---
CHAPTER EIGHT PRIMARY CONTACT 
8-4    SOLO FLIGHT 
Remember that the field elevation may be considerably different from that 
of your home field.  Use your best estimation and adjust accordingly.  
Once on deck, notify your base of the situation.  
 
ii. Lost communications.  Should you experience lost communications, you may 
just have one bad channel.  Try calling tower, ground, approach, or area 
common.  Also, try setting in the manual frequencies.  Attempt communication 
on the UHF, VHF and Back-up VHF.  If this fails, use the lost communication 
procedures as described in the SOP.  Remember, YOU are responsible for safe 
separation, so watch for other aircraft and remain VFR.  Be sure to make all 
voice reports in the blind and rock your wings approaching the break.  On final, 
double-check the Before Landing Checklist complete and for a green light from 
the tower.  Know what all of the light signals mean as they can and will be 
given to you.  Make a full-stop landing and clear the duty runway when safe.  
 
iii. PEL.  Should a PEL be necessary, execute one without hesitation at the nearest 
suitable field.  
 
iv. Emergency orbit pattern (Delta pattern).  Be familiar with the procedures for 
the emergency orbit pattern in accordance with local course rules.  Once 
established in the pattern, you may contact the FDO and ask for assistance if 
needed.  Follow the T-6B NATOPS Flight manual procedures as required.  
 
v. Unintentional Instrument Flight.  Instrument conditions are to be avoided at 
all times in Contact.  If actual instrument flight is encountered, immediately 
level your wings on the attitude gyro and time for 30 seconds.  If not VFR at the 
end of 30 seconds, attempt to regain visual flight conditions by making a 
shallow turn (15º of bank) for 180º.  
 
3. Conclusion.  Lastly, enjoy your solo.  This is your hop and it is designed to give you 
confidence in yourself and your abilities.  Know and use the standard operating procedures that 
you have been taught.  This hop will be a valuable and enjoyable step towards your becoming a 
competent Naval Aviator.

AEROBATICS 
 
900. INTRODUCTION 
 
Aerobatics is any intentional maneuver involving an abrupt change in aircraft’s attitude, 
intentionally performed spins, or other maneuvers requiring pitch/dive angles greater than 45°, 
bank angles greater than 60°, or accelerations greater than two Gs. 
 
You will be receiving training on the Anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) and the physiological 
effects of increased G loads.  Review the aircraft G limits. 
 
Refer to  Figure 9-1 for aerobatic maneuver configuration parameters.

Figure 9-1  Aerobatic Maneuver Parameters 
 
Prior to performing aerobatic maneuvers, complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic 
Checks per the NATOPS PCL and accomplish clearing turns.  For the clearing turns, use a 
minimum of 45º AOB and turn for a minimum of 180º.  Throughout the turn thoroughly check 
the area for  other aircraft. 
 
Start your aerobatic maneuvers from an altitude which will permit a complete maneuver and a 
return to straight and level flight at or above 6000 feet.  You must not exceed the maximum 
altitude permitted for your operating area.  The maneuvers performed require approximately 
3000 feet vertically. 
 
901. RULES AND PRECAUTIONS FOR AEROBATIC FLIGHT 
 
Due to their unique nature, there are certain rules and precautions you must observe prior to 
performing any aerobatic maneuver.  Flight Rules and Regulations (FRR) and local SOP will 
prescribe restrictions governing the airspace within which you may perform aerobatic 
maneuvers.  Ensure that you are thoroughly familiar with these regulations.  Strict compliance is 
mandatory.  

--- PAGE 176 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-2    AEROBATICS 
902. SECTION LINES AND GROUND REFERENCE POINTS 
 
The maneuver descriptions and procedures of the various aerobatic maneuvers often refer to 
section lines and ground reference points.  Understanding how to select and use these 
geographical references will greatly enhance your ability to remain oriented during the various 
aerobatic maneuvers. 
 
Much of the area you will fly over is rural farm land (Whiting) or beachline/waterways (Corpus 
Christi).  The lines which separate one "section" of land from another is called a "section line." 
These lines commonly run north/south or east/west in long, straight lines and are easily identified 
from the air.  During the various maneuvers, these section lines are utilized as a reference to 
maintain directional control.  Since some maneuvers involve a reversal in the direction of flight, 
it becomes necessary to select a line which extends both in front of and behind you.  Highways, 
utility cuts or even beachlines may also be utilized, provided they are linear and of sufficient 
length. 
 
Maneuvers such as the Barrel Roll or Wingover require the use of a ground reference point 
which is 90º from your initial heading.  Ensure that the points which you select are prominent 
and easily seen, remembering that you will have to relocate them rapidly as you are passing 
through unusual attitudes.  The rate at which you must scan while performing the maneuvers 
does not allow the time to search for a hard-to-see reference point.  It is permissible to perform 
aerobatics “on top” of a cloud layer without the use of ground references.  Use compass headings 
and altitudes for alignment.  Care must be taken to stay within a designated working area. 
 
903. CLEARING TURNS 
 
During aerobatic flight, attitude, altitude and direction of flight change rapidly.  You must 
therefore exercise extreme caution by ensuring the immediate area is clear of other aircraft and 
that no danger of midair collision exists.  A clearing turn, as the name implies, allows you to 
clear the area in which you are operating.  Use a minimum of 45º angle of bank and turn for a 
minimum of 180º of heading change.  Two 90º turns in opposite directions will suffice.  The 
direction of the last clearing turn shall be in the direction in which the maneuver will be 
performed.  Throughout the turn, check the area thoroughly for other aircraft.  Continue the turn 
until you have the desired airspeed and sufficient ground references to maintain orientation 
during the maneuver.  Remember 180º of turn is a minimum, not an absolute.  One clearing turn 
and Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist may suffice for a series of aerobatic 
maneuvers. 
 
If the number of section lines or ground references is limited, then a teardrop maneuver is an 
effective means of performing the clearing turn while positioning the aircraft for the next 
maneuver.  This may be performed by turning to place the nose approximately 45º from the 
section line, timing for 7-10 seconds, and then turning back to the reciprocal of the original 
heading.

PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-3 
Common Errors 
 
a. Failure to plan or execute the clearing turn(s) so that the chosen ground references are 
properly positioned to allow for adequate orientation during the subsequent 
maneuver.  
 
b. Not "clearing" the area sufficiently during the turn.  
 
c. Poor basic airwork during the clearing turn(s), resulting in the aircraft not being at the 
correct altitude and/or airspeed to commence the planned maneuver in a timely 
fashion.  
 
d. Failure to execute the maneuver within the cleared airspace. 
 
904. G- INDUCED LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS  
 
G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) is a fainting episode caused by gravity-induced 
physiological stresses on the human body.  The most commonly experienced G-forces are 
encountered by pilots during positive acceleration maneuvers (such as pulling out of a dive or 
turning at high angles of bank).  This type of positive G-force (+Gs) is directed from head to 
foot, and therefore imparts a feeling of being pressed into the seat.  
 
The ultimate effect of these forces on the human body is a tendency for blood to pool both in the 
lower abdomen and the extremities.  This pooling effect dramatically reduces the volume of 
blood available to the eyes and brain, thereby critically reducing the oxygen available to sustain 
vision and conscious brain function.  The typical G-LOC sequence of progression is as follows:  
 
a. Grayout — peripheral vi sion is progressively impaired. 
 
b. Blackout — vision is lost completely.  
 
c. Loss of consciousness. 
 
Once G-LOC occurs, it typically lasts from 15-30 seconds.  Once consciousness is regained, the 
individual usually exhibits a period of uncontrolled muscle spasms followed by disorientation or 
a "dream-like" state which can last from a few seconds to several minutes.  Some pilots have 
described post G-LOC feelings of detachment, apathy and temporal distortion.  Amnesia of the 
entire episode is a common occurrence.  Impairment of piloting skills may last for as long as 30 
minutes.  
 
Navy and Air Force investigators have identified G-LOC as a probable causal factor in numerous 
Class A mishaps.  The Air Force estimates that at least 12% of all Tac-Air pilots have 
experienced actual G-LOC at least once.  G-loading capability in the T-6B is comparable to most 
tactical jets, and therefore can easily cause G-LOC among the inexperienced or unprepared pilot. 
 
 

--- PAGE 178 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-4    AEROBATICS 
Most T-6B G-LOC episodes occur during rapid G-loading of 3 to 5 G’s over 2 to 5 second 
intervals.  Pilots can prepare themselves for the physical stress of rapid accelerations and 
therefore prevent G-LOC by taking certain precautions: 
 
1. Learn and use the proper Anti- G Straining Maneuver (AGSM), more commonly called the 
"HICK Maneuver."  There are two components to the recommended AGSM:  
 
a. The first component is a continuous and maximum contraction (if necessary) of all 
skeletal muscles including the arms, legs, chest, and abdominal muscles.  This tensing 
of the skeletal muscles restricts blood flow in the G-dependent areas of the body and 
thereby assists in the retention of blood in the thoracic region (including the heart) 
and the brain.  
 
b. The second component of the AGSM involves repeated closing of the respiratory 
tract at 2.5 to 3.0-second intervals.  Its purpose is to counter the downward G force by 
expanding the lungs and increasing the chest pressure, thereby forcing blood to flow 
from the heart to the brain.  
 
The respiratory tract is an open breathing system which starts at the nose and mouth and ends 
deep in the lungs.  It can be completely closed off at several different points, the most effective 
of which is the glottis.  Closing the glottis (which is located behind the "Adam’s Apple") yields 
the highest increase of chest pressure.  The glottis can be closed off by saying the word "HICK" 
and catching it about ¾ of the way through the word ("Hiii-").  This should be done after a deep 
inspiration, followed by forcefully closing the glottis as you say "HICK."  Bear down for 2.5 to 
3.0 seconds, then rapidly exhale by finishing the word HICK ("-ka").  This is immediately 
followed by the next deep inhalation, repeating the cycle until the G-loading is discontinued.  
 
The exhalation and inhalation phase should last for no more than 0.5 to 1.0 second.  Since the 
blood pressure falls dramatically during this phase, its duration must be kept to a minimum.  
 
WARNING 
 
Do not hold your respiratory straining too long (more than five 
seconds) since this will prevent the blood from returning to the 
heart properly and may result in loss of consciousness. 
 
Anticipate the onset of high G forces whenever possible.  Skeletal muscles should be tensed prior 
to the onset, coupled with the "HICK" respiratory cycle as the G-loading increases.  Initiating the 
AGSM too early can inhibit the body’s natural cardiovascular reflex responses, while beginning 
too late creates a deficit situation which may be difficult to overcome.  
 
NOTE 
 
If properly performed, the AGSM should provide adequate 
protection against G-LOC while performing the various aerobatic 
maneuvers.  If you experience difficulty, or are in doubt as to 
whether or not you are executing the maneuver correctly, see your 
squadron flight surgeon or wing Aeromedical Safety Officer. 

--- PAGE 179 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-5 
2. Inter-cockpit communication between aircrew is imperative.  Both individuals must rely on 
the other not to apply high G forces without first giving prior warning.  Historically poor crew 
communication has been a major causal factor in G-LOC episodes.  During high G maneuvers, 
G-suit inflation can inadvertently key the radio transmit switch on the PCL.  Take care to 
position your leg to prevent this from occurring and blocking communications with your IP. 
 
3. Be prepared physically. 
 
a. Avoid flying if ill or extremely fatigued.  
 
b. Maintain an adequate fluid intake and do not skip meals.  
 
c. Stay in shape.  The optimum fitness program for increasing G- tolerance is a 
combination of moderate weight training and cardiovascular aerobic exercise 
(running, walking, swimming, etc.) 2-3 times weekly.  Avoid excessive long distance 
running (more than 25 miles per week) or overly intense weight training.  These will 
typically result in lower blood pressure and heart rate which may decrease G-
tolerance. 
 
4. G awareness Exercise/G warm-up maneuver:  Accomplish a G-awareness exercise on 
sorties that include maneuvers that require or may result in 3 or more Gs.  This may be 
accomplished by performing the following procedures: 
 
a. Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist.  Notify the other 
crewmember that you are going to commence the G-awareness Exercise. 
 
b. The G-awareness exercise should be a level or slightly descending turn, using 
maximum power.  Begin the maneuver with sufficient airspeed to sustain 4 Gs.  For 
planning purposes, use approximately 200-220 knots minimum for a level to slightly 
descending turn where the nose remains within 10° of the horizon.  
 
c. The G-onset rate should be slow and smooth, allowing sufficient time to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the AGSM and determine G-tolerance.  Increase Gs to approximately 
4 Gs and maintain for approximately 4 to 5 breathing cycles in order to allow full 
cardiovascular response (approximately 180°
 of turn). 
 
d. For advanced aerobatic and formation training, the G- awareness exercise should be 
flown to G-loads of 4 - 5 Gs. 
 
905. CONTACT UNUSUAL ATTITUDES 
 
1. Description.  Recovery may be required due to an improperly flown maneuver, 
disorientation, area boundaries (lateral or vertical), an aircraft malfunction, or traffic conflicts. 
 

--- PAGE 180 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-6    AEROBATICS 
2. General.  The diverse and demanding missions performed by military aircraft often require 
maneuvers which involve unusual attitudes.  An effective military pilot must therefore be trained 
to quickly recognize and then safely recover from unusual attitudes.  This must often be 
accomplished while relying almost exclusively upon the interpretation of visual cues from 
outside the cockpit.  In this stage of training you will perform the procedures for recovery from 
various unusual attitudes utilizing what is primarily a scan of visual references located outside 
the cockpit. 
 
a. The IP will configure the aircraft commensurate with entering an aerobatic maneuver 
of choice.  Refer to Figure 9-1.  
 
b. The instructor will then smoothly maneuver the aircraft so as to place it in an unusual 
attitude.  
 
c. Once directed by the instructor, assume the controls and recover the aircraft in 
accordance with the following procedures.  Recovery shall be accomplished by 6000 
feet AGL.  
 
Nose-High Recovery 
 
A nose-high attitude can be encountered with insufficient airspeed to continue the maneuver. 
Immediate and proper recovery procedures prevent aggravated stall and spin.  Expeditious return 
to level flight from a nose-high attitude, without departing controlled flight or exceeding aircraft 
limits.

AEROBATICS   9-7 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. Set power to MAX (as required in low airspeed situations) and initiate a coordinated 
roll with backpressure to bring the nose of the aircraft down to the nearest horizon.  
Depending on initial airspeed and aircraft attitude, a wings-level, inverted attitude 
may be reached.  As the nose approaches the horizon, roll to an upright attitude 
(Figure 9-2).  
 
b. If the airspeed is low, the rollout may be delayed until the nose is definitely below the 
horizon.  In some cases, the nose has to be flown well below the horizon to regain 
enough airspeed to feel positive pressure on the controls.  When airspeed is sufficient, 
roll wings level, raise the nose, check for normal oil pressure, and use power as 
required to recover to level flight.  
 
c. Do not be too aggressive when pulling to the horizon or pulling up from a nose- low 
attitude.  The stick shaker and airframe buffet indicate a potential for stall.  Decrease 
back-stick pressure before the stall.  
 
d. In all cases, observe system limitations when operating near zero-G.  
 
e. During some nose-high, low airspeed situations, when the aircraft responds to inputs 
slowly due to low airspeed or torque effect, a reduction in power may be required 
(usually below 60% torque) and all available control authority may be required to 
smoothly return the aircraft to level flight.  If the aircraft does not respond normally, 
or if situational awareness is lost, an OCF recovery should be accomplished. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
Failure to set power to MAX (as required in low airspeed situations). 
 
Nose-Low Recovery. 
 
Aerobatics require nose-low attitudes.  Immediate and proper recovery procedures prevent a 
high-speed dive or excessive G-forces.  Expeditious recovery to level flight from a nose-low 
attitude with minimum altitude loss and without exceeding aircraft limits.

Figure 9-3  Nose-Low Recovery 
 
5. Procedures. 
 
Roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon.  Once wings level, smoothly apply backpressure to bring 
the aircraft to level flight.  Use power and speed brake as required (Figure 9-3).  Do not exceed 
maximum allowable airspeed (316 KIAS).  Airspeed may continue to increase as the nose is 
raised, and maximum airspeed can occur just before level flight is attained.  G-loading increases 
during recovery.  Accomplish a proper AGSM.  Approaching 200 KIAS or greater, set PCL to 
idle and speed brake as required. 
 
6. Common Errors. 
 
Not reducing power and extending speed brake to prevent excessive airspeed. 
 
Inverted Recovery. 
 
Immediate and proper recovery procedures prevent a high-speed dive or excessive G-forces.  
Expeditious recovery to level flight from an inverted attitude with minimum altitude loss and 
without exceeding aircraft limits. 
 
7. Procedures. 
 
a. When slightly nose-high, nose-low, or near an inverted position, recover by rolling in 
the shortest direction to set the aircraft in an upright position adding power as 
required.

b. For purely inverted recoveries, execute a coordinated roll to the nearest horizon.  
 
8. Common Errors. 
 
Not rolling in shortest direction to horizon. 
 
906. LOOP 
 
1. Description.  The loop is a 360° turn in the vertical plane with constant heading and nose 
track.  Because it is executed in a single plane, the elevator is the principle control surface. 
Ailerons and rudder are used to maintain directional control and coordinated flight.  The 
maneuver is complete when wings are level at the horizon on the same heading as at entry. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9-4  Loop 
 
2. General.  The Loop is one of the most rudimentary aerobatic maneuvers, yet one which 
requires skill and practice to consistently perform well.  The nose pitch rate should be constant, 
but the aft stick force required to obtain this will vary with airspeed and "G" loading.  Directional 
control is maintained by adjusting rudder input as the airspeed varies, thereby maintaining 
balanced flight.  Aileron is used only in making corrections to maintain the wings parallel with 
the horizon throughout the entire maneuver. 
 
3. Procedures.  
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 230-250 KIAS, power at MAX. 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 

--- PAGE 184 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-10    AEROBATICS 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn and roll out on or parallel to a 
section line if available.  During the last 90º of turn, lower the nose slightly and 
accelerate to 230-250 KIAS.  The increased airspeed will require a slight amount of 
left  rudder to maintain balanced flight. 
 
b. Recheck the wings level and clear the airspace above you.  Just prior to entry, check 
and report the entry altitude over the ICS.  Commence the AGSM and immediately 
start a smooth straight pull up accelerating to 4 Gs within two to three seconds.  Do 
not use the aileron.  
 
c. Recheck the wings level as the nose passes through the horizon.  Adjust stick pressure 
as necessary to keep the nose moving at a constant rate.  Increase right rudder 
pressure as airspeed decreases. 
 
d. Shortly after passing the vertical position, tilt your head back and visually locate the 
opposite horizon.  Correct with aileron as necessary to maintain the wings parallel to 
the horizon.  Check the nose in relation to the section line and correct directional 
deviations as necessary by adjusting the rudder input. 
 
e. Airspeed will reach its slowest point at the top of the Loop (100-120 KIAS).  The 
greatest amount of right rudder input will therefore be required at this point in order 
to maintain balanced flight.  The amount of aft stick force required to maintain a 
constant nose pitch rate will have decreased significantly from the initial pull-up.  
Maintain positive "G" loading and wings parallel to the horizon.  
 
f. Allow the nose to fall through the opposite horizon, adjusting the amount of aft stick 
pressure to maintain a constant pitch rate.  Fly the aircraft’s nose along the section 
line, relaxing right rudder pressure as airspeed is quickly regained. 
 
g. Continue to relax right rudder pressure as the airspeed increases in the dive and 
smoothly increase aft stick pressure as necessary to maintain a constant pitch rate. 
The recovery will again require approximately 4 Gs, so remember to resume the 
AGSM. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to check and report the altitude prior to entry.  It is hard to recover on the 
altitude you began the maneuver when you do not know what it is. 
 
b. Poor directional control caused by failure to maintain balanced flight with the proper 
amount of right rudder as airspeed is lost and then regained.  Poor rudder control is 
easily detected by checking the alignment of the nose and the section line.  
Remember that the required rudder input varies as airspeed varies.  Almost constant 
rudder adjustment will be required during the maneuver. 
 
 

--- PAGE 185 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-11 
c. Poor directional control caused by failure to keep the wings parallel to the horizon 
throughout the maneuver.  The most common tendency by far is to pull the stick 
slightly to the right when pulling the nose up during the 4 G entry.  Keep the stick 
centered longitudinally as the entry input is made.  Check and correct the wing 
attitude often.  
 
d. Poor execution of the initial pull-up with respect to G loading and/or timing. 
Remember, 4Gs in two to three seconds.  Scan the accelerometer.  Excessive G-
loading and/or loading the aircraft too quickly will cause an excessively rapid 
deceleration, and may result in overstress.  Insufficient G-loading, or taking too long 
to obtain the correct acceleration, will deplete the aircraft’s energy state, resulting in a 
stalled or near-stalled condition when approaching the inverted position. 
 
e. Relaxing too much back -stick pressure while passing through the inverted position at 
the top of the Loop.  This will result in a "floating" sensation.  Remember to maintain 
some positive G-loading throughout the entire maneuver.  Conversely, failure to relax 
sufficient back-stick pressure over the top will result in excessive angle of attack and 
stick shakers.  If this occurs, relax the back-stick pressure slightly. 
 
f. Failure to initiate the pull-out soon enough during the second half of the Loop.  This 
results in excessive airspeed and recovery below the initial altitude. 
 
907. WINGOVER  
 
1. Description.  The Wingover is a 180º reversal in the direction of flight accomplished by 
combining a smooth climbing turn for 90º with a smooth diving turn for 90º.  Recovery should 
be on the same altitude and approximately the same airspeed at which the maneuver was started. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9-5  Wingover 
 
 

--- PAGE 186 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-12    AEROBATICS 
2. General.  The Wingover will develop your ability to smoothly control the aircraft in 
balanced flight through constantly changing attitudes and airspeeds.  It is a slow and gentle 
maneuver when properly executed.  No abrupt control movements are necessary.  The maneuver 
may be initiated in either direction and is always performed in a series of two.  You should 
therefore complete the series on the same heading that the first Wingover was initiated.  Flying 
the maneuver in series will enable you to develop a "feel" for the changing control pressures and 
the rhythm of the maneuver.  Successive Wingovers, when continued without interruption, serve 
as clearing turns for the next series. 
 
When your instructor first demonstrates the Wingover, it is of primary importance that you 
acquire a mental picture of the path through which the aircraft is flying.  Notice the appearance 
of the nose and the wings in relation to the ground and the horizon at various points during the 
maneuver.  Once you are able to visualize this, the Wingover is merely a matter of flying the 
aircraft in balanced flight through this pattern.  Since you are learning to fly the aircraft in a 
predetermined pattern, keep your scan primarily outside of the cockpit.  Use your instruments 
only for an occasional reference to crosscheck your sensory impressions. 
 
The rate of roll should be constant throughout the maneuver.  The nose should always move at a 
constant rate in relation to the horizon as it describes arcs, first above and then below the 
horizon.  Remember that in turns to the right, torque and slipstream effect must be offset with a 
greater amount of rudder input than in turns to the left.  Proper performance of the maneuver 
demands smooth coordination of control pressures to maintain balanced flight.  The rate of pitch 
and roll during the Wingover is relatively slow, therefore the resultant increased G-loading is 
relatively slight.  It should not be necessary to exceed 2.0 Gs at any time during the maneuver. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 200-220 KIAS.  Set power to 80% (MAX in 
high area). 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn and roll out with the required 
ground references.  Pick a prominent reference point on the horizon 90º to either side 
of the nose, in the direction you intend to perform the maneuver. 
 
b. Begin in straight- and-level flight, with briefed entry airspeed and power setting.  
Select the desired reference point on the horizon or ground, and align the aircraft so 
the reference point is directly off a wingtip.  Blend aileron, rudder, and elevator 
pressures simultaneously to start a gradual climbing turn in the direction of the 
reference point.  The initial bank should be very shallow to prevent excessive turn 
rate.  As the nose is raised, the airspeed decreases, causing the rate of turn to increase.  
Time the turn and pull-up so the nose reaches the highest pitch attitude 
(approximately 45°) when the aircraft has turned 45° or halfway to the reference 
point.  Use outside references and the attitude indicator to crosscheck these pitch-and-
bank attitudes.  Bank continues to increase as the nose falls.  The aircraft should be 

--- PAGE 187 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-13 
pointed at the reference point as a maximum bank of 90° is reached and the nose 
reaches the horizon.  The lowest airspeed occurs just as the nose reaches the horizon.  
 
c. Do not freeze the pitch or bank at the horizon.  Passing the horizon, let the nose fall, 
and begin rolling out of bank.  The second half of the leaf (nose below horizon) 
should be symmetric and approximately the same size as the first half (nose above the 
horizon).  The bank should change at the same rate as during the nose up portion of 
the leaf.  When the aircraft has turned 135°, the nose should be at its lowest attitude 
and the bank should be 45°.  Continue blending control stick and rudder pressure to 
simultaneously raise the nose and level the wings.  Monitor the progress of the turn 
by checking the outside reference point (off opposite shoulder from maneuver start).  
The aircraft should be wings level at entry airspeed as the nose reaches the horizon, 
having completed 180° of turn. 
 
d. Without delay, begin the second leaf in the opposite direction of the first.  Repeat 
steps b and c. 
 
e. Upon completion of the series, the aircraft should once again be established in level 
balanced flight, on the original heading and altitude.  
 
NOTE 
 
Set up perpendicular to a long road or section line.  Visualize the 
road as the straight line part of a dollar sign ($).  The two turns of 
the maneuver complete the “S” portion of the dollar sign.  If 
ground references are unavailable, the heading bug can be set to 
the initial heading and used to monitor the progress of the turns. 
 
During the nose up part of turns, pull to put the bottom foot (foot on inside of turn) on 
top of the horizon and roll around it until reaching approximately 60° bank. 
 
When bringing the nose back to the horizon from a nose-low attitude, the number of 
knots below wings level airspeed should be approximately equal to the number of 
degrees nose-low.  For example, if the wings desired level airspeed is 220 knots, the 
airspeed should be approximately 190 knots at 30° nose-low, 200 knots at 20° nose-
low, etc. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Rushing the maneuver.  Remember, the Wingover is a relatively slow and finesse 
maneuver. 
 
b. Failure to obtain 45º nose up and 45º AOB simultaneously.  This is usually caused by 
an excessive roll rate and/or insufficient back-stick pressure during the initial pull-up. 
Once the AOB exceeds 45º, it is difficult to raise the nose any higher.  This type of 
error will result in excessive airspeed at the 90º checkpoint.  As the aircraft rolls, 

--- PAGE 188 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-14    AEROBATICS 
smoothly increase the back-stick pressure so as to obtain 45º nose up simultaneously 
with 45º AOB.  The required back-stick pressure reaches a maximum at 
approximately this point.  You must then continue to roll towards the 90º checkpoint 
at a constant rate while beginning to relax the back-stick pressure.  By the time you 
reach 90º AOB you should only have enough back-stick to keep from feeling light in 
your seat (i.e., slight positive G-loading).   
 
c. Exceeding  90º AOB. 
 
d. Holding excessive back-stick pressure at the 90º checkpoint, thereby "pulling" the 
nose through and obtaining the reciprocal heading too early during the recovery.  
Conversely, releasing all of the back-stick pressure, thereby inducing a zero or 
negative G state. 
 
e. Poor timing of the roll and pitch rate during recovery.  The wings should come level 
simultaneously as the nose reaches the level flight attitude. 
 
f. Commencing the second Wingover in the series off airspeed, heading, altitude, etc.  
 
908. BARREL ROLL  
 
1. Description.  A barrel roll is a maneuver in which the aircraft is rolled 360° about an 
imaginary point which bears 45° off the nose of the aircraft (Figure 9-6).  Definite seat pressure 
should be felt throughout the roll.  Practice in both directions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9-6  Barrel Roll 
 

--- PAGE 189 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-15 
2. General.  The Barrel Roll will help develop your confidence, coordination and "sense of 
feel" while flying the aircraft through rapidly changing attitudes and airspeeds.  Since attitude, 
heading, etc. change so rapidly, this is an excellent maneuver for developing your ability to 
maintain orientation. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 200-220 KIAS.  Set power to 80% (MAX in 
high area). 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn and roll out on or parallel to a 
section line.  Pick a prominent reference point on the horizon 90º to either side of the 
nose, in the direction you intend to perform the maneuver. 
 
b. Recheck the wings level and clear the airspace above you.  Just prior to entry, check 
and report the entry altitude over the ICS.  Commence the maneuver by smoothly 
raising the nose while keeping the wings level.  As the nose passes ~20° above the 
horizon, roll and pull so that the nose travels around in an arcing path towards the 
selected 90º checkpoint.  After 45º of  turn, the angle of bank should be 90º and the 
nose will be at its highest point during the maneuver (approximately 55-60º above the 
horizon). 
 
c. Continue rolling the aircraft at a constant rate until in a wings level, inverted attitude, 
heading directly at the 90º reference point on the horizon.  Your nose should be 
slightly above the horizon, airspeed 100-120 KIAS.  Fly the aircraft through the 
inverted position and continue rolling at a constant rate, completing the maneuver on 
the original heading and altitude.  Maintain a positive "G" load throughout the 
maneuver.  If performed properly, 2.5 Gs should not be exceeded at any time during 
the maneuver. 
 
d. The nose should appear to make an arcing path about the imaginary point on the 
horizon 45º from your original heading.  The last half of the arc will, therefore, be the 
same distance below the horizon that the first half is above the horizon.  Remember, 
as the airspeed decreases towards the top of the maneuver, it will be necessary to 
increase the deflection of the ailerons, rudder, and elevator to maintain a constant rate 
of pitch and roll.  Conversely, as the airspeed increases towards the bottom of the 
maneuver it will be necessary to decrease the deflection of the ailerons, rudder, and 
elevator to maintain a constant rate of pitch and roll.  Notice that this roll is started as 
a climbing turn, which then becomes a continuous roll at a constant rate. 
 
e. Maintain orientation throughout the maneuver by concentrating on your reference 
points.  Maintain a constant rate of roll and nose movement.  Inscribing a small arc 
above the horizon in the first half of the maneuver and a larger arc below the horizon 
in the last half will result in too great an airspeed at the completion of the maneuver 

--- PAGE 190 ---
CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT 
9-16    AEROBATICS 
or unnecessarily high "G" forces to recover on airspeed.  During the roll out to the 
original heading, adjusting the back-stick pressure will enable you to recover on 
altitude and at aerobatic cruise airspeed. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to raise the nose high enough during the first 45º of turn.  Generally, this will 
result in a correspondingly nose low attitude and proportionally high airspeed when 
recovery is made. 
 
b. Improperly coordinating the rate of roll with the rate of pitch.  An insufficient roll rate 
will result in an overshoot of the intended recovery heading while an excessive roll 
rate will result in an undershoot.  A common tendency is to allow the roll rate to 
accelerate after passing the inverted position. 
 
c. Failure to maintain balanced flight.  Too much or too little rudder will produce 
essentially the same results as too fast or too slow a rate of roll, respectively. 
 
d. Failing to scan ahead for the reference point and/or section line and thereby losing 
orientation.  
 
e. Student not looking outside enough, attempting to execute Instrument Barrel Roll. 
 
909. AILERON ROLL 
 
1. Description.  The aileron roll is a 360° roll about the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  The 
maneuver is complete when the wings are parallel to the horizon.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9-7  Aileron Roll 

--- PAGE 191 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-17 
2. General.  Plan your clearing turn so as to roll out on a good section line or with the nose 
aimed at a prominent reference point.  When performing the maneuver make your control inputs 
smooth, brisk and positive. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 180-220 KIAS.  Set power to 80%. 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn and roll out with the required 
ground references. 
 
b. Smoothly raise the nose to 5-10° nose-high pitch attitude.  Relax back -stick pressure 
and stop nose track, then roll the aircraft left or right using coordinated aileron and 
rudder.  
 
c. As the aircraft approaches wings level, neutralize the rudder and aileron, and return to 
level flight.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. F ailure to relax the back-stick pressure prior to rolling.  Back-stick pressure is 
required only to set the initial nose attitude.  Failure to relax the back-stick pressure 
will cause the nose to follow an arcing path rather than having the aircraft roll about 
its longitudinal axis.  It will also cause the nose to drop rapidly while passing the 
inverted position. 
 
b. Delaying initiation of the roll once the nose high attitude is set.  This causes excessive 
airspeed decay, which results in a sluggish roll performance. 
 
910. SPLIT-S 
 
1. Description.  The split-S combines the first half of an aileron roll with the last half of a 
loop.  The aircraft climbs during entry and descends during recovery.  The maneuver is complete 
when the aircraft returns to level flight.

Figure 9-8  Split-S 
 
NOTE 
 
Student solos are strictly prohibited from performing the Split-S,  
Immelmann, Cloverlear, Combination Maneuver, and intentional 
sustained inverted flight maneuvers.  Failure to comply with this 
safety related restriction is considered sufficient grounds for 
attrition from flight training.  
 
2. General.  The Split-S provides a means of rapidly converting the potential energy of 
altitude into airspeed while reversing the direction of flight.  Once the pull is commenced from 
the inverted position, airspeed builds rapidly and altitude is quickly lost.  If performed correctly, 
the altitude loss should be approximately 3000 feet.  Remember to select a long, well defined 
section line which extends behind as well as in front of you. 
 
3. Procedures.  
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Transition to 150 KIAS. 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn.  After rolling out of the clearing 
turn, reduce power to idle and maintain altitude while slowing to 140 KIAS. 
 
b. Raise the nose to an approximately 5-10° pitch attitude (crook of front windshield on 
the horizon). 

--- PAGE 193 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-19 
c. Roll the aircraft to the wings-level, inverted attitude.  Once inverted, neutralize the 
ailerons and apply slight forward stick pressure to momentarily maintain straight and 
level flight.  Quickly verify that the wings are level by referencing the horizon and 
correct as necessary. 
 
d. Apply backpressure to bring the nose through the horizon.  Attempt to achieve 
maximum nose track, without stalling.  
 
e. Airspeed and G-loading (approximately 4 Gs) increase during the pullout.  
 
f. Perform a proper AGSM. 
 
g. Check oil pressure within normal limits.  Report the oil pressure over the ICS and 
reset power as required.  
 
NOTE 
 
Like the loop, attempt to set up the maneuver over a road or 
section line.  Ensure wings are level inverted before starting pull.  
Looking at successive points above the canopy bow (as described 
on the back half of the loop) that lead in a straight line from below 
the aircraft out to the horizon can also help ensure a straight pull. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to maintain altitude and/or balanced flight during the deceleration. 
 
b. Delaying roll initiation, airspeed decay causes difficult lateral control. 
 
c. Failure to obtain, check and/or correct wings level prior to the pull-out.  This results 
in disorientation and a rolling pull-out. 
 
d. Pulling too much back-stick before sufficient airspeed has been gained resulting in a 
near-stalled AOA.  
 
911. CUBAN EIGHT 
 
1. Description.  Each half of this maneuver is a combination of a slightly modified loop and 
Immelman.  The first portion of each leaf is approximately the first five-eighths of a loop 
followed by a half roll.  The pull and roll is then repeated in the opposite direction.  The 
maneuver looks like an 8 on its side.  The maneuver is complete at level flight, with entry 
airspeed and on original heading.

3. Procedures.  
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 230-250 KIAS.  Set power to MAX. 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn.  During the last 90º of turn, lower 
the nose slightly and accelerate to 230-250 KIAS. 
 
b. Recheck the wings level and clear the airspace above you.  Just prior to entry, check 
and report the entry altitude over the ICS.  Commence the AGSM and immediately 
start a smooth straight pull-up, accelerating to 4Gs within two to three seconds.  Do 
not use the aileron. 
 
c. Recheck the wings level as the nose passes through the horizon.  Adjust stick pressure 
as necessary to keep the nose moving at a constant rate.  Increase right rudder 
pressure as airspeed decreases. 
 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 195 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-21 
d. Shortly after passing the vertical position, tilt your head back and visually locate the 
opposite horizon.  Correct with aileron as necessary to maintain the wings parallel to 
the horizon.  Check the nose in relation to the section line and correct directional 
deviations as necessary by adjusting the rudder input. 
 
e. Airspeed will reach its slowest point at the top of the modified loop (100-120 KIAS).  
The greatest amount of right rudder input will therefore be required at this point in 
order to maintain balanced flight.  The amount of aft stick force required to maintain 
a constant nose pitch rate will have decreased significantly from the initial pull-up.  
Maintain positive G-loading and wings parallel to the horizon. 
 
f. Allow the nose to fall through the opposite horizon, adjusting the amount of aft stick 
pressure to maintain a constant pitch rate.  As the nose approaches a point 45º below 
the opposite horizon, slow the nose movement by releasing back-stick pressure and 
commence a roll in either direction.  During the roll, it will take slight forward stick 
pressure as the aircraft passes wings vertical to hold the heading and allow the nose to 
continue pitching downward to a position 45º below the horizon. 
 
g. After completing the half roll, maintain 45° nose-low until beginning the pull up for 
the second half of the maneuver.  Plan to initiate the pull up to attain briefed entry 
airspeed at the horizon (passing through level flight).  Begin the pull-up 
approximately 35 to 40 KIAS below briefed entry airspeed (airspeed lead point 
approximately equal to number of degrees of nose-low pitch).  Continue the pull-up 
into another loop entry.  The second half of the Cuban-8 is identical to the first except 
the roll is in the opposite direction.  
 
NOTE 
 
Use ground references, or heading bug, as in other over the top 
maneuvers.  Upon reaching 45° nose-low inverted (seat on the 
horizon), momentarily freeze the control stick before the 
coordinated roll.  To maintain 45° nose-low, pick a point on the 
ground and freeze it in the windscreen.  Verbalizing the roll 
direction on the first half of the maneuver will help ensure the roll 
on the second half of the maneuver is in the correct direction.   
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Same common errors as the first half of a Loop. 
 
b. Improper forward stick application during roll resulting in less than the desired 45º 
nose down attitude.  
 
 
 
912. IMMELMANN

9-22    AEROBATICS 
 
1. Description.  The Immelmann is a half loop followed by a half roll, all flown in the same 
vertical plane.  The maneuver is complete after a momentary pause in level flight with wings 
level on an opposite heading from entry.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9-10  Immelmann 
 
2. General.  This maneuver offers a quick means of reversing the direction of flight while 
trading excess airspeed for increased altitude.  Remember to select a long, well defined section 
line which extends behind as well as in front of you. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 230-250 KIAS.  Set power to MAX. 
 
 CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
 CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn.  During the last 90º of turn, lower 
the nose slightly and accelerate to 230-250 KIAS. 
 
b. Recheck the wings level and clear the airspace above you.  Just prior to entry, check 
and report the entry altitude over the ICS.  Commence the AGSM and immediately 
start a smooth straight pull-up, accelerating to  4 Gs within 2 - 3 seconds.  Do not use 
the aileron.  
 
c. Recheck the wings level as the nose passes through the horizon.  Adjust stick pressure 
as necessary to keep the nose moving at a constant rate.  Increase right rudder 
pressure as airspeed decreases. 
 
d. Shortly after passing the vertical position, tilt your head back and visually locate the 

--- PAGE 197 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-23 
opposite horizon.  Correct with aileron as necessary to maintain the wings parallel to 
the horizon.  Check the nose in relation to the section line and correct directional 
deviations as necessary by adjusting the rudder input.  
 
e. As the nose approaches a point 10º above the opposite horizon ("FCP canopy bow" 
on the horizon,) slow the rate of nose movement by neutralizing back-stick pressure. 
Commence a roll in either direction to the upright position.  Anticipate the need for 
slight forward stick pressure as the aircraft passes 90º of roll. 
 
f. The maneuver is complete when the aircraft is once again in the level flight attitude 
on the reciprocal heading.  The airspeed should be approximately 120 KIAS.  The 
nose attitude will therefore be slightly high. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Same common errors as the first half of a Loop.  
 
b. Commencing the roll to upright attitude either too early or too late.  
 
c. Utilizing improper rudder and/or poorly coordinated rudder inputs during the roll. 
 
913. CLOVERLEAF 
 
1. Description.  The cloverleaf is composed of four identical maneuvers, each of which 
changes heading by 90°.  The pull up is similar to the loop, although with less G-load.  The top 
part is a rolling pull to the horizon 90° displaced from the original heading.  The pulling roll 
resembles a nose-high recovery.  The lower part or pull through is flown like a split-S.  The 
maneuver is complete in level flight after four leaves in the same direction.  Fewer than four 
leaves may be performed when practicing the maneuver.

2. General.  Combine elements of the loop, roll, and split-S into a fluid maneuver. 
 
3. Procedures.  
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 200-220 KIAS.  Set power to MAX. 
 
 CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
 CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn. 
 
b. Begin in straight- and-level flight, with briefed entry airspeed and power setting.  Pick 
a reference point 90° off the nose in the desired direction.  The initial part of the 
maneuver is a straight pullup similar to a loop except for a slightly lower G-loading 
(2- 3Gs).  
 
c. As the aircraft reaches 45° nose-high (feet on the horizon), begin a coordinated roll 
toward the 90° reference point.  Allow the nose to continue climbing during the roll 
so the maneuver is fairly slow and lazy.  
 
d. Coordinate the pull and roll so the nose passes through the reference point with the 
aircraft wings level, inverted, and at a relatively low airspeed (100-120 KIAS).  Do 
not stare at the airspeed indicator, but note the airspeed at the inverted point.  Keep 
the wings level and pull through the bottom of the maneuver as in the split-S.  To 

--- PAGE 199 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER NINE 
 
AEROBATICS   9-25 
avoid excessive G and airspeed at the bottom, attempt to MAX perform (as in the 
split-S) once the nose passes the horizon.  
 
e. Approaching the horizon in the pull through, reduce back pressure to allow 
acceleration to entry airspeed at the horizon.  Complete three additional leaves in the 
same direction.  
 
NOTE 
 
Use section lines or prominent roads off of the wingtip in the 
direction of turn to visually identify 90° points.  Begin roll when 
your feet are on the horizon.  A combination of roll and pull is 
necessary to be inverted wings level over the reference point.  
Crosscheck G-load at horizon after each pull though the bottom.  
Reaching 200-220 knots at the horizon, G may then have to be 
reduced to the 2-3 Gs required for the initial pull up by releasing 
back-stick pressure.  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
Getting disorientated in the maneuver. 
 
914. COMBINATION MANEUVER 
 
1. Description.  A Combination Maneuver is nothing more than combining a series of 
aerobatic maneuvers into a single evolution.  A maximum of FOUR maneuvers may be "linked" 
together.  
 
2. General.  The aerobatic training you receive is NOT intended to prepare you for the air 
show circuit.  As previously discussed, aerobatic training IS taught to allow you to make the 
aircraft perform precise and controlled maneuvers, flying the aircraft throughout more of its 
envelope.  
 
By combining maneuvers, you will need to plan ahead to the second maneuver while completing 
the first half.  As always, maintain a constant and vigilant scan, especially during the maneuvers.  
 
Energy management should be a part of the discussion so as to plan maneuvers to maximize 
airspeed/altitude, while staying within assigned airspace.  This should be a major consideration 
for which maneuvers are linked together and in what order.  
 
Example:  Cuban Eight - Barrell Roll - Immelmann - Split-S  
 
3. Procedures.  Perform all maneuvers IAW the procedures previously set forth for the 
maneuvers you intend to fly.  The SNA shall pre-plan his/her Combination Maneuvers and 
thoroughly brief his/her intentions to the IP before execution.

9-26    AEROBATICS 
915. INVERTED FLIGHT 
 
1. Description.  The Inverted Flight maneuver is the intentional flying of the T-6B in the 
inverted wings level attitude for a maximum of 15 seconds.  Review T-6B NATOPS Flight 
Manual regarding inverted flight.  
 
2. General. 
 
It is imperative that you tighten your restraint harness to the maximum extent possible (without 
cutting off your circulation).  Regardless of how tight you think your belts are, once inverted, 
you will have the sensation of being pulled from the aircraft.  Notice the nose attitude.  The T-6B 
requires a relatively high nose attitude in order to maintain level flight. 
 
Reference points that may be used to keep the aircraft from changing altitude while inverted are: 
 
a. Front Cockpit = crook of front windshield on the horizon 
 
b. Rear Cockpit = intersection of rear canopy bow and canopy rail on the horizon  
 
Monitor the oil pressure and clock to remain within limits.  Ensure the rudder pedals are within 
reach in this attitude. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 180-200 KIAS. 
 
CHECKLIST:  Complete the Pre-Stalling, Spinning and Aerobatic Checklist. 
 
CLEARING TURNS:  Commence a clearing turn. 
 
b. Raise the nose to an approximately 5-10° pitch attitude, stop the nose movement by 
relaxing back-stick pressure. 
 
c. Roll the aircraft to the wings-level, inverted attitude.  Once inverted, neutralize the 
ailerons and apply enough forward stick pressure to maintain altitude.  Immediately 
note the clock and check oil pressure.  Return to normal flight immediately if oil 
pressure is not in the normal range. 
 
d. Prior to 15 seconds inverted, use coordinated aileron and rudder to roll the aircraft 
back to the upright flight attitude.  Recheck the oil pressure in the normal range. 
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Failure to maintain straight-and-level flight while inverted. 
 
b. Poor coordination of control inputs during the roll to the inverted and/or upright 
positions.

ANGLE OF ATTACK APPROACHES    10-1 
CHAPTER TEN 
ANGLE OF ATTACK APPROACHES 
 
1000. INTRODUCTION 
 
This chapter contains procedures to conduct Angle of Attach (AOA) approaches.  The AOA 
approach is typically used by carrier based airplanes to perform a precision approach to the 
carrier.  The skills learned by conducting AOA approaches in the T-6B will, however, be used as 
a building block for advanced jet training. 
 
1001. ANGLE OF ATTACK APPROACHES 
 
1. Description.  The AOA approach is a descending 180º balanced turn to final followed by a 
normal flared landing.  During the approach, the optimum AOA is maintained by controlling 
nose/pitch attitude and rate of descent is controlled by power adjustment.  
 
2. General.  You are introduced to angle of attack approaches for two primary reasons.  One 
is to simply broaden your exposure to different aspects of aviation.  Additionally, AOA 
approaches are commonplace in jet and multi-engine aircraft and are virtually mandatory when 
used with a visual glideslope indicator during carrier landings.  Should you end up flying jets or 
multi-engine aircraft, your exposure to AOA approaches in the T-6B will be beneficial.  
 
AOA is displayed on PFD and AOA indexer.  The PFD provides continuous AOA readout.  
When the gear is down, the indexer displays one or two of three illuminated symbols.  
Depending on which symbols are illuminated, the indexer tells you if you are flying at optimum, 
higher than optimum, or less than optimum AOA.  Refer to the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual 
for further discussion of the AOA system.  
 
For a pattern with gear down, flaps LDG, and PCL set for a 3° glidepath, the optimum approach 
speed (center donut) is approximately 100 KIAS at maximum landing weight.  As landing 
weight decreases, approach AOA (center donut) continues to provide the optimum approach 
speed and maneuver speed (regardless of bank angle).  Optimum approach airspeed decreases 
approximately 1 knot for every 100 pounds of fuel burned. 
 
The AOA system in the T-6B is calibrated in units of AOA, not degrees.  An adjustment is 
automatically made to the readout based on whether the flaps are up, set to TO, or LDG.  
Because of this, optimum AOA is 10.5 units, regardless of configuration.  
 
As you can see, flying an approach at optimum AOA gives you an adequate safety margin 
(approach airspeed above stall speed), while keeping your approach and landing speed low. 
 
3. Procedures. 
 
a. AOA approaches will normally be flown after one or more touch- and-go landings. 
After a touch-and-go, climb out at 120 KIAS with the flaps up.  Climb to pattern 
altitude.  

--- PAGE 202 ---
CHAPTER TEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
10-2    ANGLE OF ATTACK APPROACHES 
b. During the turn, notify other aircraft in the pattern that your are performing an AOA 
approach.  
 
c. Level off at pattern altitude at 120 KIAS.  TRANSTION as follows: 
 
No Flap AOA:  Established on downwind, reduce power to 15-20% and slow to 
optimum AOA (~110 KIAS).  Carefully adjust power to 25-30% to maintain pattern 
altitude and adjust nose attitude to maintain optimum AOA, an amber donut, “O” on 
the indexer.  Maintain 10-11 units and a ¾ wingtip distance on downwind. 
 
TO Flap AOA:  Established on downwind, reduce power 15-20%, lower flaps to TO 
and slow to optimum AOA (~100 KIAS).  Carefully adjust power to 25-30% to 
maintain pattern altitude and adjust nose attitude to maintain optimum AOA, an 
amber donut, “O” on the indexer.  Maintain 10-11 units and a ¾ wingtip distance on 
downwind. 
 
LDG Flap AOA:  Established on downwind, reduce power to 15-20%, lower flaps to 
LDG and slow to optimum AOA (~95 KIAS).  Carefully adjust power to 25-30% to 
maintain pattern altitude and adjust nose attitude to maintain optimum AOA, an 
amber donut, “O” on the indexer.  Maintain 10-11 units and a ¾ wingtip distance on 
downwind. 
 
d. Perform the Before Landing Checklist prior to abeam position.  
 
e. At the 180º position, initiate final turn by reducing power to approximately 15-20%. 
Lower the nose slightly to maintain 10-11 units, commence the TURN and TALK.  
Your pattern over the ground should be the same as in previous landings.  You may 
require less angle of bank with TO Flap/LDG Flap approaches.  Using the same angle 
of bank as in a normal approach would result in too tight a turn.  
 
f. During the approach, scan the AOA indexer, the aimpoint and the altimeter.  Adjust 
power and attitude as necessary to maintain the proper rate of descent and 10-11 
units.  If the green "slow" chevron ("V") lights up, your AOA is higher than optimum 
and your airspeed is too slow.  To correct, lower the nose slightly.  The chevron 
points in the direction the nose needs to go.  Too low of a nose attitude results in 
illumination of the red "fast" chevron, indicating less than optimum AOA and 
excessive airspeed.  In this case, the correct response is to raise the nose.  Again, all 
nose attitude adjustments must be coordinated with power to control altitude/rate of 
descent.  
 
g. Rate of descent should be constant.  Vary the angle of bank and power as necessary to 
arrive at the proper 90º position (10-11 units AOA, 450 feet AGL or ½ the pattern 
altitude in feet AGL, perpendicular to the runway).  Maintain 10-11 units AOA 
through the rest of the turn to final.  When you are established on final with 1200-
1500 feet of straightaway from the runway threshold, 150-250 feet of altitude, and 
maintain 10-11 units AOA until just prior to the runway threshold.  On short final, 
transition to a normal flared landing.

ANGLE OF ATTACK APPROACHES    10-3 
NOTE 
 
The intent of this training is to do an AOA approach to a normal 
flared landing, not an AOA approach to an AOA landing!  
 
4. Common Errors. 
 
a. Excessive nose attitude corrections.  Scanning the indexer will indicate if you are not 
at optimum AOA.  A glance at the gauge will show how far from optimum.  Correct 
only as much as necessary.  
 
b. Failure to coordinate power and attitude changes.  Keep in mind that power affects 
AOA attitude.  Remember to control AOA with attitude and rate of descent with 
power.  
 
c. Using the same angle of bank as utilized during normal landing patterns. 
 
d. Failure to transition to a normal flared landing.

NIGHT CONTACT    11-1 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
NIGHT CONTACT 
 
1100. INTRODUCTION 
 
You are now ready to enter one of the most interesting stages of your flight training - NIGHT 
CONTACT.  There is no reason for you to approach it with any more apprehension than you did 
the transition from day to night driving in an automobile.  In fact, you will find much in common 
between the two experiences.  Just as you did not try to drive at night until you had perfected 
your skill in handling an automobile in the daylight, you now come to night flying with an 
improved feel of the airplane and the ability to make your airplane do precisely what you want it 
to do.  One of the greatest tactical advantages of Naval Aviation is our superior night operational 
capability.  As a fleet Naval Aviator, a great percentage of your flying will be conducted at night. 
 
Your first night flight is not intended to teach you all there is to know about night flying, but to 
familiarize you with the fundamentals.  You will come to realize that there are differences in 
night flying, but that a careful study of these differences will make flying at night as safe as in 
the daytime.  
 
Good night flying, like good night driving, requires increased care.  You will have to identify 
obstructions and other aircraft, not by entire outline, but by such small identifying features as a 
few colored lights.  This is not difficult if you leave the ground well prepared for the conditions 
you will meet, and if you remain constantly alert.  Once you are in the air, clear of all ground 
obstructions, the only possible obstruction remaining will be other aircraft.  Obviously it is 
essential that you know the location of other aircraft.  
 
1101. NIGHT FLYING PHYSIOLOGY 
 
1. Night Vision.  You will remember from lectures on flight physiology that the eye uses 
different parts for night vision than for day vision.  Because of the difference in function of the 
rods and cones, technique must be changed in order to spot objects at night:  Do not stare at a 
spot, but scan the vicinity of the sky in which you believe the object to be located.  
 
The eyes must be adapted for night vision; the pupils must dilate and the rods must be brought 
into full use.  It takes approximately 30 minutes for the eyes to become completely adapted, and 
only 10 seconds for all adaptation to be lost in bright light.  Adaptation may be accomplished by 
total darkness or by gradually approaching darkness such as normal daylight to sunset to night.  
 
2. Vertigo.  Vertigo, in aviation, is a feeling of dizziness and disorientation caused by doubt 
in visual interpretation of your attitude.  This feeling is often experienced at night from lack of a 
well-defined horizon.  The period immediately after takeoff, leaving a well lighted runway and 
entering complete darkness, brings on this feeling of disorientation.  Trust and use your flight 
instruments.  
 
3. Moving and Stationary Lights.  Often you will not be able to see anything of the aircraft 
ahead except its tail light or strobe lights.  In such cases, it will be difficult to judge distance, 

--- PAGE 206 ---
CHAPTER ELEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT 
11-2    NIGHT CONTACT 
since the only criterion for judgment will be changing intensity at changing distance; therefore, 
you will have to check its movement in relation to known references to ascertain relative 
movement.  Ordinarily, you can judge distance and relative motion by the distance between two 
lights on the same aircraft.  You will undoubtedly experience some difficulty in discerning 
moving lights from fixed lights or stars.  This can be further complicated by the autokinetic 
effect, the apparent motion of stationary objects.  Again, this may be overcome by using known 
references for comparison.  
 
1102. PERSONAL PREPARATION 
 
Briefs for all night flights will be given prior to commencing syllabus night operations.  Ensure 
that you eat a good meal prior to attending the brief.  There are many times when the night’s 
flight operations will be lengthy, so ensure that your body is properly fueled.  
 
Students are expected to know Emergency procedures thoroughly prior to the brief and will be 
quizzed on them by the Instructor Pilot.  If you are not absolutely certain about all Night 
procedures and Emergency procedures, make sure you are certain before you leave the briefing 
room.  
 
In addition to the normal flight equipment required for day flight operations, the following 
equipment is required for all night flights:  
 
1. Flashlight with clear and red lenses.  
 
2. Clear visor installed in your helmet (prior to the brief).  
 
1103. NIGHT GROUND PROCEDURES 
 
This section provides the basic procedures essential to the safe operation of the airplane on the 
ground at night.  These procedures cover night operations both before and after flight. 
 
1104. PREFLIGHT PROCEDURES 
 
The night preflight will include all items checked on day preflight with the following additions:  
 
1. Check the operation of all interior lights in both cockpits during the cockpit check.  
 
2. With the battery on, complete a check of all exterior lights.  Conduct a walk-around of the 
aircraft to ensure operation of all exterior lights.  Ensure any discrepancies are corrected prior to 
flight.  
 
1105. LIGHT SIGNALS 
 
The student must have a precise knowledge of all light signals to safely conduct night operations.  
The T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual contains the required ground handling signals. 
 

--- PAGE 207 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT  CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 
NIGHT CONTACT    11-3 
1106. START 
 
The start will be accomplished in the same manner as daylight operations except that the NAV 
lights switch will be on and the ANTI-COLLISION (strobe) lights will be OFF.  Cockpit lights 
will dim during start.  When the pilot is ready for the start, he will signal the lineman by rotating 
the flashlight at the lineman or if ambient light permits, use appropriate hand signals for 
clearance to start.  The lineman will repeat the signal with his wand or appropriate hand signal 
and will man the fire extinguisher for the start.  
 
NOTE 
 
In the line area, where adequate light is available, hand signals 
may be used as in daylight operations.  However, when lighting is 
not adequate, hand signals must be passed as light signals (see the 
T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual for ground handling signals).  
 
1107. TAXI 
 
The Before Taxi Checklist shall be completed and clearance from Ground Control received prior 
to taxi in accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and local SOP.  All taxiing will be 
conducted in accordance with current course rules.  Caution must be exercised to prevent 
excessive taxi speeds caused by lack of outside references and depth perception.  Landing/Taxi 
lights should be used during all night taxi evolutions in areas not adequately illuminated.  
Consideration will be given to courteous use of lights to avoid the disorientation of other aircraft, 
ground support, and tower personnel.  Taxi is only permitted on lighted, authorized taxiways (see 
SOP).  If there is any doubt as to your position on the field or any confusion caused by light 
signals, STOP!  Do not continue until reoriented.  Turn Landing/Taxi lights off while conducting  
the Overspeed Governor and Before Takeoff Checklists or if a delay is encountered at the hold 
short line awaiting takeoff. 
 
1108. NIGHT FIELD LIGHTING  
 
1. BLUE LIGHTS:  Blue lights mark all taxiways.  There should be blue lights on both sides 
of the taxiway.  
 
2. WHITE LIGHTS:  White lights mark the boundaries of the duty runway.  
 
3. GREEN LIGHTS:  Green lights mark the threshold of the duty runway.  
 
4. RED LIGHTS:  Red lights mark all obstructions on the airfield.  
 
5. ROTATING BEACON:  There is a rotating white and green beacon located at fields that 
are open for night operations.  A military airfield’s white light will be split by a 3° void.  This 
will give the impression that there are two separate, closely timed flashes of light.  A civilian 
airport has a solid white light and can be easily distinguished from a military field.

6. TETRAHEDRON:  A wind tetrahedron points in the direction of the wind and is lighted 
with red lights along the left rear and side of the tetrahedron and green lights on the right rear, 
side and top of the tetrahedron.  
 
7. WIND TEE:  A lighted wind tee is located in the grass area immediately west of the 
control tower at NAS Corpus.  The wind tee is free-swinging and outlined in green lights.  
 
1109. OVERSPEED GOVERNOR CHECKLIST 
 
Taxi to the appropriate runup area for the duty runway and night operations, (see current SOP). 
Complete the Overspeed Governor and Before Takeoff Checklist as in daytime operations.  Taxi 
to the holdshort line in accordance with local course rules.  
 
1110. INBOUND TAXI PROCEDURES 
 
1. Landing traffic will turn off only on lighted taxiways (see current SOP for any exceptions ).  
 
2. When clear of the duty runway, switch to Ground Control and complete the After Landing 
Checklist (strobe lights will be turned off or IAW local SOP).  
 
3. Make the appropriate call to Ground Control for taxi.  
 
4. Taxi via the most direct route to the appropriate line.  Inbound Taxi procedures are the 
same as Outbound Taxi procedures.  See current SOP for inbound taxi routes.  
 
1111. ENGINE SHUTDOWN 
 
1. Engine shutdown will be conducte d in accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual 
and the current SOP. 
 
2. The navigation lights will remain on until the propeller has come to a complete stop.  
 
1112. POSTFLIGHT INSPECTION  
 
1. All aircraft will be postflighted following each flight in accordance with the T-6B 
NATOPS Flight Manual.  
 
2. Complete a thorough postflight inspection utilizing a white-lens flashlight.  
 
1113. NIGHT CONTACT FLIGHT PROCEDURES 
 
This section provides the basic procedures required to conduct night flight operations.  While 
these procedures form a basis, the expanded procedures for each Training Air Wing may be 
varied.  Consult your most current SOP for further amplification.

NIGHT CONTACT    11-5 
1114. TAKEOFF PROCEDURES 
 
1. All takeoffs will be conducted in accordance with the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and 
the current SOP.  
 
2. Call for takeoff clearance IAW local SOP/Course Rules.  
 
3. Once takeoff clearance has been issued, position on the duty runway.  Crossing the 
holdshort line, complete the Lineup Checklist.  Position the aircraft on the runway centerline. 
Commence Takeoff procedures IAW daytime operations.  
 
1115. HOMEFIELD DEPARTURE 
 
Comply with tower instructions and make departure in accordance with local SOP.  
 
1116. LANDING PATTERN 
 
Entry to touch-and-go fields will be in accordance with the current SOP/Course Rules.  Break 
procedures will remain the same as day operations.  After the break or crosswind turn, roll out 
with a ¾ wingtip distance on the downwind leg.  
 
At night, the wingtip distance remains the same as in the day.  Crosscheck the PFD for the 
reciprocal heading of the duty runway to assist in maintaining wingtip distance abeam.  
Crosscheck the attitude gyro to maintain wings level in the downwind leg.  
 
Transition the same as daytime.  At the 180º position, start the approach turn and make the 
appropriate radio call in accordance with local SOP.  The approach and landing at night are the 
same as in the daytime.  Your 90º position and final checkpoints remain the same.  The 
Landing/Taxi lights will be used in accordance with local Course Rules.  
 
Avoid fixating on the intended point of landing.  A waveoff should be executed if you cannot 
touch down in the first one-third of the runway or if lined up extremely right or left of runway 
centerline.  
 
Initiating the landing transition, smoothly and continuously reduce the PCL to idle and control 
your rate of descent with a smooth, continuous flare until touchdown.  It is imperative that you 
focus on the end of the runway vice directly over the nose.  "Spotting the deck" may result in a 
hard landing.  Remember, at night, peripheral cues are greatly reduced requiring a continuous 
scan. 
 
After touchdown on the main gear, smoothly lower the nose to the deck.  Smoothly apply power 
to full forward; following engine spool-up, raise the nose to the takeoff attitude.  Make a normal 
takeoff by maintaining directional control with rudders and climb out at 120 KIAS.  Make 
heading corrections as necessary to maintain runway centerline as you proceed upwind.  When 
the proper interval has been established and you are cleared downwind by the tower (at 
controlled fields only), you may begin your crosswind turn utilizing a maximum of 45º angle of 
bank  If the preceding aircraft is full-stop, wait until it is 45º behind the wingtip.

NOTE 
 
Due to lack of ground reference points at night, attention should be 
given to the effects of crosswinds throughout the landing patterns.  
 
1117. WAVEOFF 
 
If you waveoff for any reason during an approach, execute the normal waveoff procedures.  
Waveoff procedures are the same as during day operation.  Maintain 120 KIAS and climb IAW 
SOP/Course Rules.  Turn downwind with proper interval (or as directed by the tower).  If you 
are given a waveoff prior to the 180º position, make a waveoff in a racetrack pattern in 
accordance with local SOP.  Fly up the side of the runway dictated by local Course Rules or as 
tower directs.  Take interval in the pattern when you can safely do so.  Remember, you are under 
tower control at homefield.  If you are unable to comply with directions given by the tower, let 
them know. 
 
It is mandatory to execute a waveoff under any of the following conditions:  
 
1. Waveoff lights from the RDO or wheels watch.  
 
2. Red light from the tower.  
 
3. Verbal command from the IP, RDO, crash crew, or the tower.  
 
4. No clearance received from the tower for a touch-and-go or full-stop landing.  
 
5. Unable to touch down safely on the first one-third of runway.  
 
It is the prerogative of the pilot to initiate a waveoff at any point in the approach when he/she 
feels uncomfortable. 
 
1118. HOMEFIELD ARRIVALS 
 
Refer to current SOP. 
 
1119. HOMEFIELD BREAK 
 
The Night Break procedures are basically the same as day procedures in accordance with local 
SOP.  
 
1120. LANDING 
 
Landing and rollout will be conducted the same as during daylight operations.

The Emergency procedures for the T-6B are outlined in the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and 
the Pocket Checklist. 
 
1122. VISUAL AIRCRAFT-TO-AIRCRAFT SIGNALS  
 
In the event of lost communications, it is necessary to have standard visual aircraft-to-aircraft 
signals.  
 
1. "FOLLOW ME" - If another aircraft joins on you, turns its external lights off and on 
several times, and then continues ahead of you, this means "follow me."  
 
2. "CONTINUE ON COURSE" - While following another aircraft as described above, it 
turns its external lights off and on several times and breaks away sharply to the RIGHT, this 
means "continue on course."  
 
3. "ORBIT THIS POSITION" - If the aircraft you are following turns its external lights on 
and off several times and then breaks sharply to the LEFT, this means "orbit this position."  
Establish an orbit and remain there until the aircraft again joins up and signals to follow.  
 
4. "I MUST LAND IMMEDIATELY" - If it becomes necessary to make an immediate 
landing and you have no radios, signal to the aircraft that joins up with you by using your 
flashlight.  With a lighted flashlight pointed directly towards the other aircraft, rotate the light in 
a circular motion similar to your signal to the lineman for start.

B100. INTRODUCTION 
 
Radio communications are a critical link in the air traffic control system.  The link can be a 
strong bond between aircrew and controller, but it can be broken with surprising speed, leading 
to disastrous results.  The most important aspect of aircrew-controller communications is 
understanding.  The controller must understand what you want to do before he can properly carry 
out his control duties.  Similarly, you must know exactly what he wants you to do.  Although 
brevity is important, concise phraseology may not always be adequate.  Use whatever words are 
necessary to state your message.  It cannot be stressed enough that communication plays a vital 
role in the flight evolution.  With experience, it should become second nature.  
 
B101. COMMUNICATION 
 
There are several things to consider when using aircraft radios: 
 
1. First, pause and listen before you transmit.  If you hear others talking, the keying of your 
transmitter will be futile.  You will probably jam the frequency, causing them to repeat their call. 
If you have changed frequencies, allow your receiver time to tune, then listen and make sure the 
frequency is clear before you begin your transmission.  Also, do not transmit during an exchange 
between the controller and another aircraft.  For example, if the controller asks another aircraft a 
question, you should wait until the other aircraft has answered before transmitting.  
 
2. Think before keying your transmitter.  Know what you want to say.  If it is a lengthy 
transmission such as a flight plan, write it down.  Avoid saying "and" prior to each transmission.  
 
3. After your call, release the button and wait a few seconds before calling again.  The 
controller may be jotting down your call sign, looking for your flight plan, transmitting on a 
different frequency, or switching his transmitter to your frequency.  
 
4. Be alert to the sounds, or lack of sounds, in your receiver.  Check your volume and 
frequency setting.  Check your equipment to ensure that your microphone is not stuck in the 
transmit position.  Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods of time 
because of unintentional transmitter operation.  This situation is referred to as a "stuck mike." 
Avoid revealing your innermost thoughts during this time.  
 
5. Be sure that you are within the performance range of station equipment.  UHF radios are 
limited to "line-of-sight" communications.  Remember that as altitude increases, radio range 
increases.  The approximate range of your radio can be determined by using the range chart 
located in the Meteorology section of your Flight Information Handbook (reproduced as  
Figure 1). 
 
For example, an aircraft at 5000 feet will have an approximate radio range of 50 nautical miles to 
a ground station.  

--- PAGE 216 ---
APPENDIX B PRIMARY CONTACT 
B-2    COMMUNICATIONS 
6. Know what to expect.  As you progress through each flight you should know what is 
expected to happen.  In order to do this, you and controllers will make certain transmissions.  If 
you know what is to be said ahead of time, responding correctly will be much easier.  Use the 
proper formats and terminology to assist you in making brief and concise transmissions.  Good 
phraseology enhances safety and is the mark of a true professional.  
 
NOTE 
 
Active ELT signals can interfere with normal communications.  If 
an ELT is broadcasting on Guard, temporarily switch the UHF to 
"T/R" (vice "T/R +G").  Wait a few minutes and re-select "T/R." 
Repeat as necessary.

B102. CALL SIGNS 
 
1. Ground Station Call Signs .  When calling a ground station, you should begin with the 
name of the facility being called, followed by the type of facility being called; for example:  
 
Clearance Delivery  "Clearance Delivery" 
Ground Control  "North Ground," "Navy Corpus Ground" 
Airport Traffic Control Tower  "North Tower," "Navy Corpus Tower" 
Radar Departure Control  "Pensacola Departure," "Corpus Departure" 
Radar or Nonradar Approach  "Pensacola Approach," "Corpus Approach" 
FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center  "Jacksonville Center," "Houston Center" 
FAA Flight Service Station (FSS)  "Pensacola Radio," "San Angelo Radio" 
USAF Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV)  "Eglin Metro," "Kelly Metro" 
 
 
 

--- PAGE 217 ---
PRIMARY CONTACT APPENDIX B 
 
COMMUNICATIONS    B-3 
2. Aircraft Call Signs.  Improper or abbreviated call signs can result in a pilot’s executing a 
clearance intended for another aircraft.  As an example, assume that a controller issues an 
approach clearance to an aircraft at the bottom of a holding stack and an aircraft with a similar 
call sign (at the top of the stack) acknowledges the clearance with the last two or three numbers 
of his call sign.  If the aircraft at the bottom of the stack did not hear the clearance and failed to 
intervene, flight safety would be affected.  This kind of "human" error can strike swiftly and is 
extremely difficult to rectify.  You must be certain that aircraft identification is complete and 
clear before taking action on an ATC clearance.  FAA personnel should not abbreviate call signs 
of aircraft having authorized call signs.  FAA may initiate abbreviated call signs of other aircraft 
by using a prefix and the last three digits or letters of the aircraft identification after 
communications are established.  Controllers, when aware of similar or identical call signs, will 
take action to minimize errors by emphasizing certain numbers or letters, by repeating the entire 
call sign, or by repeating the prefix. 
 
B103. VERBALIZATION 
 
1. Time 
 
The 24-hour clock system is used in radio-telephone transmissions.  The hour is indicated by the 
first two figures and the minutes by the last two figures.  FAA uses Greenwich Mean Time 
(GMT), Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Zulu ("Z") for all operations.  
 
Example: 0000 ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO  
Example: 0920 ZERO NINER TWO ZERO  
 
Time may be stated in minutes only (two figures) in radio-telephone communications when no 
misunderstanding is likely to occur.  When two figures are used, the current hour (within 60 
minutes) is understood to be the time being referenced.  
 
Example: "Mobi le Radio, [Call sign], low -level, entering Victor Romeo One Zero 
Two Zero at Point Alpha at Four Three, exit Point Foxtrot." 
 
"Four Three" is understood to mean 43 minutes past the current hour.  If the call was made at 
0935 local time, the aircraft will enter the low-level route at 0943 local.  
 
Current time in use at a station is stated in the nearest quarter minute in order that pilots may use 
this information for time checks or to set their clocks.  Fractions of quarter minutes less than 
eight seconds are stated as the preceding quarter minute; fractions of quarter minutes of eight 
seconds or more are stated as the succeeding quarter minute. 
 
Example: 0929:05 TIME: ZERO NINER TWO NINER STRAIGHT UP 0929:10 
TIME: ZERO NINER TWO NINER AND ONE QUARTER

B-4    COMMUNICATIONS 
2. Figures 
 
Digits indicating hundreds and thousands in round numbers, such as ceiling heights and upper 
wind levels up to 9999, shall be spoken as follows:  
 
Example: 500 FIVE HUNDRED 
 4500 FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
 
Numbers above 9999 shall be spoken by separating the digits preceding the word "thousand."  
 
Example: 10,000 ONE ZERO THOUSAND  
 13,400 ONE THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED  
All other numbers shall be transmitted by pronouncing each digit.  
Example: 10 ONE ZERO 
When a radio frequency contains a decimal point, the decimal point is spoken as "point" or 
"decimal."  
 
Example: 322.1 THREE TWO TWO POINT ONE  
 322.1 THREE TWO TWO DECIMAL ONE  
3. Altitudes and Flight Levels 
Up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL (FL180), state the separate digits of the thousands, plus 
the hundreds, if appropriate.  
 
Example: 12,000 ONE TWO THOUSAND  
 12,500 ONE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED  
At and above 18,000 feet MSL (FL180), state the words "flight level" followed by the separate 
digits of the flight level.  
 
Example: 19,000 FLIGHT LEVEL ONE NINER ZERO  
Feet in MSL (Mean Sea Level) is understood in altitudes; therefore it is not necessary to say 
"feet."  
 
4. Directions 
State the three digits of all magnetic courses, bearings, headings, or wind directions.  All are 
assumed to be magnetic.  The word "true" must be added when it applies.  
 
Example:    (magnetic course) 005 ZERO ZERO FIVE  
   (true course) 050 ZERO FIVE ZERO TRUE  
   (magnetic bearing) 360 THREE SIX ZERO  
   (magnetic heading) 100 ONE ZERO ZERO  
   (wind direction) 220 TWO TWO ZERO

PRIMARY CONTACT APPENDIX B 
 
COMMUNICATIONS    B-5 
5. Speeds 
State the separate digits of the speed followed by the word "knots."  The controller may omit the 
"knots" when ordering a speed adjustment:  "Reduce/increase speed to one five zero."  
 
Example: 250 TWO FIVE ZERO KNOTS  
 185 ONE EIGHT FIVE KNOTS  
 95 NINER FIVE KNOTS  
6. Phonetic Alphabet 
 
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) phonetic alphabet (Figure 2) is used by 
FAA personnel when communications conditions are such that the information cannot be readily 
received without their use.  Air traffic control facilities may also request pilots to use phonetic 
letter equivalents when aircraft with similar sounding identifications are receiving 
communications on the same frequency.  
 
Pilots should use the phonetic alphabet when identifying their aircraft during initial contact with 
air traffic control facilities.  Additionally, use the phonetic equivalents for single letters and to 
spell out groups of letters or difficult words during adverse communications conditions.

8. Basic Formats 
 
Adherence to the following guidelines will assist you in the application of proper radio 
communication:  
 
a. The format for contacting an agency is always, "Agency called, aircraft identification, 
message."  
 
If at a loss for the "right" words, remember: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and 
WHAT you want.  
 
b. When instructed to squawk or ident on your IFF, no verbal response is necessary 
unless confusion exists.  
 
Example: "[Call sign], _____ DEPARTURE, squawk 0622."  (Dial Code 0622 in 
aircraft’s IFF transponder.)  
 
Example: "[Call sign], _____ DEPARTURE, IDENT."  (Momentarily select the 
ident position on the transponder.)  
 
c. When advised to "contact" a new controlling agency, acknowledge with "switching" 
and repeat the specific frequency.  
 
Example: "[Call sign], _____ DEPARTURE, contact Houston Center on 322.4." 
"[Call sign], switching 322.4."  
 
If unable to contact the new agency on the frequency given, return to the transferring 
agency and state, "No joy."  The transferring agency will give you an alternate 
frequency to reattempt contact.

d. Always report leaving an altitude.  Unless requested, it is not necessary to report 
reaching an altitude.  
 
Example: "[Call sign], _____ CENTER, climb and maintain FL210."  
  "[Call sign], leaving FL180 for FL210."  
 
e. When in a climb and instructed to climb to a new altitude (i.e., other than that issued 
in your clearance), you should acknowledge the new altitude.  
 
Example: (you are passing 6000 for 9000 and Departure says):  
  "[Call sign], _____ DEPARTURE, climb and maintain 13,000."  
  "[Call sign], climbing to 13,000."  
 
f. When instructed to "report" a specific point or time of information, report only the 
item requested.  
 
Example: "[Call sign], _____ APPROACH, report ROMEK ."  
"[Call sign], WILCO." (Upon reaching ROMEK): "_____ 
APPROACH, [Call sign], ROMEK."  
 
Example: "[Call sign], _____ CENTER, say altitude passing."  
 "[Call sign], passing 5500."  
 
g. "Roger" nice-to-know information.  
 
Example:  "[Call sign], your clearance is on request." 
  "[Call sign], roger." 
 
Example:  "[Call sign], _____ DEPARTURE, radar contact." 
  "[Call sign], roger." 
 
h. "Wilco" instructions or commands which do not require a readback.  You may wilco 
several commands with a single wilco.  
 
Example:  "[Call sign], proceed direct to MARYS, report reaching."  
  "[Call sign], wilco."  (Covers two commands: 1) proceed MARYS 
and 2) Report MARYS.)  
 
or 
 
"[Call sign], proceeding direct to MARYS, wilco"  (Wilco covers the 
command not repeated; i.e., report IAF.)  
 
i. Mandatory readbacks include: headings, altimeter settings, leaving an altitude, and 
frequency assignments.

APPENDIX C 
THE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEF 
 
C100. AN OVERVIEW 
 
The Pre-Flight Briefing Guide is a general purpose format used to discuss the majority of 
contingencies or emergency considerations that might arise in the course of a normal flight.  Use 
of the Pre-Flight brief is not unique to the T-6B aircraft or to the Naval Air Training Command, 
but finds application in every aspect of Naval Aviation.  
 
Preparing the Brief.  The content of the brief includes those details relevant to communications, 
weather, navigation/flight planning and aircraft emergencies that are necessary for the safe and 
orderly conduct of a particular flight.  Use the published briefing guide to organize the 
information you want to convey and amplify it as required.  
 
No briefing is intended to be all-inclusive.  Briefings should be tailored to the mission at hand; 
i.e., a briefing for a Formation hop would involve much additional detail that would not be 
relevant to a Contact briefing.  Additionally, those missions that intend to take the aircraft into 
IMC weather would include crew coordination specifics that would not be covered in a Contact 
briefing except as a matter of contingency.  
 
Crew Coordination.  A fresh buzzword in Naval Aviation recently popularized because of the 
number of incidents or mishaps that have occurred without it and which could have easily been 
avoided with a little more of it.  A professionally prepared Pre-Flight Brief is step one toward 
maximum crew coordination and efficient mission completion.  
 
Use of Standard Operating Procedures.  Reference to Standard Operating Procedures or 
published regulations is highly encouraged during  briefings to avoid lengthy dissertations, 
provided that all members of the flight are thoroughly familiar with the procedures.  The Pre-
Flight Brief itself is founded on the premise of training and operations standardization for 
maximum combat readiness.  
 
Any questions?  An often overlooked, but perhaps most important, segment of the Pre-Flight 
briefing period which should be included in the conclusion of every brief.  Use this period to 
clarify SOP or other details that may be pertinent to the assigned mission.  The members of the 
flight that are being briefed should hold questions until the conclusion of the brief to the greatest 
extent possible.  The enclosed pages are provided as an example or guide in preparing a Pre-
Flight brief for Contact operations.  It is admittedly wordy and intended for use with local 
Standard Operating Procedures.  
 
The T-6B aircraft is inherently reliable.  The odds of any one of these contingencies arising are 
slim, but with a proper Pre-Flight brief, you will be prepared to respond confidently and 
correctly should such a situation actually occur.

C-2    THE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEF 
C101. THE BRIEFING 
 
The brief should serve several functions.  First, the brief should serve to inform all crewmembers 
about elements critical to safe mission completion.  A briefing guide shall be used to prompt the 
briefer, but all items in the briefing guide will not apply to every mission.  Items that do not 
apply may be passed over without mention.  Those items which will be handled routinely in 
accordance with a published instruction may be briefed as such.  Of particular importance to the 
Student Naval Aviator in this portion of the brief is the sequence of events or route of flight.  
Leave nothing to unspoken assumption; the instructor pilot expects his or her students to ask 
questions.  
 
Just as important to dissemination of information in briefing is the delineation of cockpit 
responsibilities.  This function is the cornerstone of crew coordination.  Put some serious thought 
into how tasks will actually be performed in normal and emergency conditions, then brief them 
as such.  All crewmembers are responsible for ensuring that the flight conforms to existing 
limitations.  Where the pilot in command does not specify stricter limits, existing SOP or the  
T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual always applies.  
 
Another function of the brief is for the pilot in command to determine whether or not his crew is 
ready to fly.  In the training command, the instructor pilot will evaluate a student’s motivation 
and degree of readiness by checking the student’s knowledge against standards established in the 
T-6B JPPT Curriculum.  
 
For all flights, each student being graded shall check existing and forecast weather, and furnish 
the instructor with a grading sheet.  The student shall bring a Master Curriculum Guide (MCG), 
Pocket Checklist, and all required charts and pubs to the brief.  The flight shall be conducted as 
briefed.  When circumstances require a change in plans, the pilot in command is responsible for 
updating the brief.  When any crewmember is unclear with regard to any changes in plans, it is 
his or her responsibility to resolve any questions.
