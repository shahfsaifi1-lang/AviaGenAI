INTRODUCTION \n \nThis Flight Training Instruction (FTI) is a Naval Air Training Command directive published by \nChief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).  The information and instructions are relative to all \ninstructors and Student Naval Aviators (SNA) operating T-6B aircraft in the Primary Phase of \ntraining in the Naval Air Training Command.  It is very important that the factual material \ncontained herein be thoroughly studied and retained. \n \nThe process by which a student is transformed into a skilled naval aviator is both complex and \ndemanding.  It can be accomplished only by intensive instruction in the air as well as in the \nclassroom.  Success, for the most part, depends upon the student’s attitude, cooperation, and \nattention to detail.  The degree of skill attained by students depends largely upon their ability to \nunderstand new material and to work hard.  Those students who cannot measure up to the high \nstandards required throughout the various phases of training, because of either their lack of \nmotivation or ability, must and will be attrited.  \n \nThis FTI does not contain all the information necessary for a student pilot to become a \nprofessional aviator.  Rather, this instruction provides a focal point and reference manual for all \nother sources of technical information, outlining and amplifying the flight procedures where \nnecessary.  This manual is designed as a training tool and is not meant to establish policy \nconcerning fleet operations.  Every effort has been made to remain in accordance with current \nfleet procedures.  It is important to note that the emergency procedures shown are to aid in the \ntopic discussion.  For all emergencies, the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual is the final authority.  \nThrough this cross-referencing and organization of information, the student pilot should be able \nto develop a thorough understanding of the manual and flight procedures that form the backbone \nof an aviation career.  \n \nCongratulations on your commencement of primary flight training.  Your hard work and \ndetermination has earned you the unique opportunity to become part of the most elite team of \naviation warriors in the world today.  The United States Naval Aviator is a highly trained \nprofessional.  The tremendous level of skill demanded by the naval air community can only be \nobtained through total dedication and sustained maximum effort.  It is imperative that every \nStudent Naval Aviator  apply himself or herself completely.  Anything less than your best effort \nis unacceptable.  Best of luck in your endeavor to earn your \"Wings of Gold.\"  \n \n101. HISTORY OF CONTACT TRAINING \n \nNaval aviation training has come a long way since 1910 when Lieutenant T. G. Ellyson was \nordered to flight instruction to become the first Naval Aviator.  Soon thereafter, the U.S. Navy \npurchased its first airplane, the Curtis Triad, at a cost of $5,500.  Since that time, naval aviation \ntechnology has progressed at a rapid rate.  The fleet aircraft of today’s Navy are tremendously \ncomplex and demanding machines, capable of astonishing performance.  Advancements in \naviation technology are only part of a much bigger picture.  Even the most modern aircraft will ",

Therefore, a \nthorough and comprehensive training program is essential for mission accomplishment.  \n \nEarly aviation pioneers suffered through many \"accidents,\" which became unwanted yet \ncommonplace occurrences.  A \"good\" landing was any one that you could walk away from!  \nToday, the safety record of naval aviation is the best it has ever been.  Accidents or \"mishaps\" \nare rare, yet do occur.  Anything greater than a zero mishap rate is undesirable.  Mishap-free \noperation is the ultimate goal, and SAFETY is a primary concern during all aspects of training.  \nThere is NO acceptable loss and NO toleration for anything less than total professionalism.  This \nis a goal we can achieve.  Your instructors will set an example that you should strive to mirror.  \n \n102. SCOPE OF INSTRUCTION \n \nSo far as is practical, all information and instructions governing T-6B aircraft procedures and the \nexecution of curriculum maneuvers will be published for inclusion in this manual.  Procedures \npeculiar to Whiting Field (TW-5) and Corpus Christi (TW-4) may be found in the TW-5 Fixed \nWing Operating Procedures (FWOP) Manual or TW-4 Standardization Notes/NAS Corpus \nChristi Course Rules. \n \nTerms that would be included ordinarily in a glossary for T-6B Contact training are defined as \nthey are used throughout the text.  \n \n1. Learning Objectives.  The course objective is broken down into Stage (Terminal) \nLearning Objectives.  Terminals are further broken down into Enabling Learning Objectives. \nThese are designed to be smaller, bite-size chunks of the overall objective.  The Terminal \nObjectives are listed in the CNATRA governing instruction.  \n \n2. Enabling Objectives, Maneuvers And Exercises.  Each event in this stage is comprised \nof various tasks the student will have to perform.  This could be performing a spin on a contact \nflight, or reciting an emergency procedure during a lecture, or answering a test question correctly \nin an end-of-course exam.  The Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) Curriculum, Flight Training \nInstruction, and Academic Training Instruction break down each of these tasks in detail. \n \nThe maneuvers or other items that you will perform on the events may be graded or nongraded.  \nThis means that this particular item may or may not be used to compare you to course training \nstandards.  This does not mean that the instructor may not evaluate a nongraded item.  The \nstudent is just as responsible, for example, for a demo (nongraded) item as for a graded  item.  If \nthe instructor determines a blatant lack of preparation for either, an unsatisfactory grade is \nwarranted.  \n \n103. CURRICULUM RESOURCES \n \n1.

It describes what each \nStudent Naval Aviator (SNA) will do in the Primary phase of training.  The maneuvers and \nexercises in the syllabus are described, as well as the standards of performance to be achieved.  \nEach event lists all of the maneuvers to be performed.  When there is no task listing in the \ndescription of an event, then another publication describes the conduct of that event.  For \nexample, although the Joint Primary Pilot Training System (JPPT) Curriculum simply lists \nAerodynamics as the event, the Aerodynamics Academic Training Instruction (ATI) lists the \nmaterial to be covered. \n \n2. FLIGHT AND ACADEMIC TRAINING INSTRUCTIONS.  These are called \"peculiar \nto aviation training\" (PAT) pubs and are produced by CNATRA specifically for each of its \ncurricula.  These PAT pubs describe the various maneuvers and exercises the SNA will be \nrequired to perform, and list any additional pubs or study material that the student may need to \nreference for an event.  The SNA is responsible for all material listed in these training \ninstructions.  Each stage of training has an associated FTI containing the information necessary \nfor a student to complete the curriculum satisfactorily.  It is every pilot’s responsibility to be \nthoroughly familiar with the contents of this manual.  Strict adherence to the manner of \nexecution of maneuvers, patterns, procedures and instructions herein promulgated is mandatory \nfor all instructors and Student Naval Aviator s operating the T-6B aircraft. \n \n3. 1500.4 (TA MANUAL) AND THE AVIATION TRAINING JACKET.  CNATRAINST \n1500.4 is commonly referred to as the Training Administration (TA) manual.  The TA manual is \nStudent Control’s guide to handling its students.  Normally, those areas of the TA manual for \nwhich the SNA is responsible will be outlined to the student upon check in.  Such student \nresponsibilities always include obtaining jacket reviews, ensuring Aviation Training Forms \n(ATF) make their way to the Aviation Training Jacket (ATJ), and updating the calendar card.  \nThese responsibilities should not be taken lightly.  The responsibility (or lack thereof) that a \nstudent displays with these administrative details can be a direct indication of how seriously a \nstudent is applying himself/ herself to an aviation training program.  \n \n4. AVIATION TRAINING FORMS.  These are records of the training events that take \nplace for a student.  They also record the instructor’s evaluation of student performance.  These \nare permanent, official documents that remain in the SNA’s jacket forever.  They are never \nremoved or altered by anyone except under very special circumstances listed in the TA manual.  \nAny student who alters or removes an ATF from his or her jacket will be subject to attrition \nunder the provisions of the TA manual.  \n \n5. NATOPS PROGRAM.  Every Student Naval Aviator  becomes familiar with Naval Air \nTraining and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) early in his or her career.  You \nwill be issued a T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual before you start ground school, and a General \nNATOPS (OPNAVINST 3710.7) should be available to you.  The NATOPS program is the \nresponsibility of all who use it.  NATOPS only works if everyone is involved.  Even as a Student \nNaval Aviator, it is your responsibility to originate changes if you find errors or ambiguities in \nthe T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual.  See the squadron NATOPS officer regarding the correct \nprocedure to submit a change recommendation to the NATOPS Flight Manual.  \n ",

The T-6B \nNATOPS Flight Manual is the definitive instruction on the operation of the aircraft.  The Pocket \nChecklist (PCL) is a convenient pocket sized listing of those items in the T-6B NATOPS Flight \nManual that would be of particular concern while airborne or at a remote location.  No student or \nflight instructor has the authority to deviate from the Flight Manual without specific written \nauthority except in specific situations.  The T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual also lists the crew \nrequirements for flying the aircraft.  There is a bank of questions in the back of the T-6B \nNATOPS Flight Manual that every aviator should be familiar with.  Both the T-6B NATOPS \nFlight Manual and the PCL list emergency procedures.  Some of these procedures are listed in \nBoldface or with asterisks next to them.  These items are memory items, and the SNA shall be \nable to recall and apply any of these procedures correctly to the appropriate aircraft malfunction.  \nIn addition to the emergency procedures, a pilot should be able to recall the Landing Checklist \nfrom memory.  Other than these, every checklist should be performed with the aid of the PCL or \nappropriate guide.  Familiarity with the PCL should be acquired in an attempt to ensure efficient \nuse under potentially arduous situations while airborne.  \n \nIn Primary Training, there is no room for libraries of publications.  T-6B aircrews must be \nthoroughly familiar with their aircraft.  They must study the Flight manual in-depth and have a \nthorough knowledge of it because no opportunity exists to do so while airborne.  The T-6B \nNATOPS Flight Manual requires the use of checklists.  Although a student may become familiar \nwith a checklist, pocket checklists are to be used to ensure no items are missed.  \n \n104. ACADEMIC/FLIGHT SUPPORT TRAINING \n \nThe terminal objective of flight support training and academics is to provide the SNA with the \nbasic knowledge and skills directly applicable to satisfactory progression in the T-6B aircraft \nflight training.  Upon completion of the academic and flight support activities, the student will be \ncapable of relating these acquired cognitive skills and applying them through simulation and \nactual flights, thus developing the motor skills and headwork necessary to meet CNATRA \nstandards to complete primary flight training.  \n \n105. STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE \n \n1. STANDARDIZATION.  Flight instruction must be highly standardized.  The syllabi that \nare currently being used are the result of constant evolution and the procedures taught are lessons \nlearned over the course of many years.  The FTI and T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual set forth the \none standardized way of doing any specific maneuver.  Adherence to these standards will be a \npart of any instructor’s evaluation of a student’s performance during an event.  Occasionally, a \nstudent may question a particular instructor’s technique, or he may think that an instructor is \nincorrect.  There is no time for protracted discussion or debate in the air.  If an instructor’s \nrequest is unclear to the student, he must request clarification.  If, however, the student feels that \nthe instructor’s methods contradict the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual or the FTI, he should \nconsult his class advisor on the appropriate way to address the issue.  In any event, when the \nstudent feels that flight safety is in jeopardy, he is bound to request a Training Time Out to \nobtain clarification.  Training Time Out is defined in section 108 of this publication. \n ",

The \ntime designated for the pre-flight briefing is equally limited and demands that both student and \ninstructor have a complete knowledge of the material to be covered in preparation for the flight. \nBriefing time should be applied to review of previous difficulties, clarification of \nmisunderstandings, and immediate flight planning.  It is essential that the instructor and the \nstudent have a common understanding of the maneuvers to be flown and employ the same \nnomenclature in order to take full advantage of the time afforded.  \n \n2. GRADES.  The adage is that if you worry about learning, the grades take care of \nthemselves.  The truth is that one should be trying to perform to the best of his or her ability at all \ntimes.  Grades are designed to do two things: compare performance to a set standard or criterion; \nand contrast performance of individuals within the same curriculum.  \n \nThere is little to be gained by sweating over grades.  There is much to learn by focusing on the \nlearning objectives for a course.  The nature of flight training is such that if one misses a step, it \nis very difficult to catch up.  The syllabus is designed to give the average student sufficient time \nand opportunity to complete the objectives.  When it becomes apparent to an instructor that \nobjectives are not being met, or the student is having difficulty, the student’s grades will reflect \nthis.  The student should not take grades as a personal affront.  The instructor should make every \neffort not only to critique the student, but also to give the student the information required to \nperform the exercise or maneuver in an acceptable manner.  The best instructors are not those \nwho give the best grades, but those who best prepare the students for their next flight.  Students \nshould simply concentrate on correctly performing the maneuvers of the next hop, and meeting \nthe stage and phase objectives.  Students who are able to do this are successful in the Naval Air \nTraining Command. \n \n3. CHECK FLIGHTS.  The student should place no special significance on designated \ncheck flights and should not anticipate failure if a superlative performance is not demonstrated.  \nThe designated check flight is merely a validation by another instructor of the evaluations other \ninstructors have given the student.  If a student fails to meet the accepted standards of progress, \nthe instructor will grade the student’s performance unsatisfactory rather than allow him to \ncontinue ahead in the syllabus.  The check pilot is obligated to judge the student fairly in \ncomparison with accepted standards. \n \n106. THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR \n \nThe flight instructor is an experienced aviator, trained to provide the student with a sound \nfoundation in the operation of the aircraft.  He has undergone a training course similar to the \nstudent’s, which familiarizes him with the curriculum maneuvers and teaches an effective means \nof presenting them.  This training comes under the heading of standardization.  The intent of \nstandardization is to provide the instructor with a logical, effective, and consistent foundation \nupon which to present any maneuver.  This in turn ensures that all students can be judged on the ",

No two instructors will be identical in their techniques and each \nmay vary his/her presentation to fit the needs of the individual student.  \n \nIn order to teach you to fly the T-6B properly, the instructor must criticize!  His/her comments \non your performance of the various maneuvers are intended to improve your understanding.  All \ncriticism by the instructor is meant to be constructive in character.  The instructor’s sole intent is \nto instill confidence and develop you into a qualified naval aviator.  \n \nYour flight instructor is a vital part of your training.  Nonetheless, you must do your part as well. \nThe one word that you will hear most from your instructor is \"PROCEDURES!\"  In order that \nyour time in the aircraft can be devoted to the improvement of maneuver performance, it is \nimperative that you learn, memorize, and understand the procedural steps required in performing \neach of the various maneuvers.  Then and only then can your instructor’s time with you be \nprofitably utilized.  The instructor is well trained and qualified to teach his/her student, but \nhis/her success requires the fullest cooperation of the student himself/herself.  If you have \nquestions about procedures or concepts, ask them.  Again, knowing procedures, both for normal \nand emergency operations, cannot be overemphasized!  They must be over-learned so that they \ncan be recalled in flight, especially during periods of high cockpit workload and stressful \nsituations. \n \nCONTRACT INSTRUCTORS.  Simulator instructors are generally civilians, contracted to the \nNavy to provide simulator flight instruction, and teach academics.  These instructors are all \nexperienced military aviators.  They are bound by the same instruction as their military \ncounterparts.  The simulator event should be treated just as a flight event.  Both events require \nthe same dedicated preparation and forethought.  The contract instructor (CI) is also responsible \nfor standardization.  If you notice a nonstandard maneuver or technique, bring it to the attention \nof the standardization officer at the squadron.  \n \n107. THE STUDENT NAVAL AVIATOR \n \nThe qualifications to become a SNA are high.  The SNA has been selected for flight training by a \nscreening process that determines his/her superiority over the average American youth with \nrespect to physical condition, intelligence, ability to grasp and retain new ideas, and apparent \nemotional stability.  Superior reasoning ability will enable him/ her to combine these talents into \nexperience that will produce a qualified naval aviator.  One critical factor of success, which \ncannot be accurately evaluated by the normal selection process, is mental attitude.  Mental \nattitude, as much as any other factor, determines the ease or difficulty with which the student \nprogresses through the training syllabus.  Under the heading of positive mental attitude come \nsuch elements as willingness to conform to military discipline, acceptance of curtailed personal \nfreedom and leisure, and the ability to encounter occasional reverses and still maintain \nenthusiasm and self-confidence.  \n \nMotivation and mental attitude are closely related.  The student’s motivation greatly affects his \nor her mental attitude and consequently his or her progress throughout training.  The majority of \nstudents have had little or no previous aviation experience.  Flight training is arduous and places ",

Therefore, motivation plays an important part \nin difficult periods.  The student who discovers that he or she does not enjoy flying but remains \nbecause of prestige or monetary compensation will find that his or her chances of successfully \ncompleting the program are poor.  The desire to earn those coveted wings of gold and the love of \nflying provide the highest motivation and the greatest likelihood of success.  \n \nWith these basic qualities as a foundation, the experience you gain as you progress through each \nstage of your training will develop the many facets of your skill and judgment.  This will allow \nyou to cope with the many and varied problems that may confront you in the handling of your \naircraft under all conditions.  Although your instructor and other personnel are at your disposal to \nhelp solve various problems, your own intelligent analysis, based on acquired knowledge, will \ngenerally permit you to arrive at correct and logical conclusions.  \n \nFlying is a highly physical attribute and, like many other acts of a physical nature, is mostly a \nmatter of coordination of hands, feet and eyes.  As far as controlling the attitude and performance \nof the aircraft is concerned, the elementary methods of flying are not at all difficult to master.  \nBut, because it is performed in an environment to which you will not be accustomed, you may \nexperience some difficulty adapting to the airborne classroom.  With your instructor’s patience \nand your own hard work and alertness, the readjustment required will occur naturally and you \nwill find that the T-6B is one of the most enjoyable classrooms in the world.  Every student \nshould remember these guidelines when managing his/her training program.  \n \n1. Your flight instructor wants  you to learn to be a professional aviator.  If in doubt, ask \nquestions and use your flight instructor to help you through problem areas.  \n \n2. Preparation is the key to professionalism.  Do not be satisfied with only knowing enough to \ncomplete the hop.  What is being taught in the primary phase has a direct transference to all \nfuture training. \n \nRemember one important thing for as long as you fly an aircraft:  You must be your own most \naggressive critic.  This does not mean that you become a mental case in the cockpit, but it does \nmean that as an aviator beginning the flight training syllabus, you must demonstrate one of the \nmost critical qualities a professional aviator has: self-discipline.  This means that you prepare for \nevery hop as if your professional reputation is at stake.  Your flights are not contests where \nsomeone is keeping score and counting your mistakes.  Your flight grades should not be as \nimportant as your own honest appraisal of your flight performance.  You are expected to come \nwell prepared, but you must expect to make mistakes.  Most of these mistakes are forgiven as \nlong as you deal with them professionally, on the spot and learn from them.  That is why they \ncall this flight training. \n \n108. TRAINING TIME OUT \n \nCNATRAINST 1500.4 (series), defines the conditions under which a Training Time Out (TTO) \nmay be requested.  It states in part, \"A TTO may be called in any training situation whenever a \nstudent or instructor expresses concern for personal safety or a need for clarification of \nprocedures or requirements exists.\" ",

      "page": 20,
      "text": "CHAPTER ONE  PRIMARY CONTACT \n1-8    INTRODUCTION TO T-6B CONTACT \nThe intent of TTO is to give students and instructors the means to stop a flight if they are not \n\"communicating\" or if either party feels they are in an unsafe position.  It will not be used to \nterminate a flight just because you are having a bad day or do not know your procedures.  \nNevertheless, do not be hesitant to use TTO if you feel the flight conditions warrant it.  \n \n109. CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT \n \nThe “Human Error” factor or inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM) is the single \nleading cause factor for Class A mishaps in modern naval aviation.  As defined in OPNAVINST \n3710.7, CRM describes the use of “specifically defined behavioral skills as an integral part of \nevery flight to improve mission effectiveness by minimizing crew preventable errors, \nmaximizing crew coordination, and optimizing risk management.”  It includes all crew members, \nequipment, and external factors involving the flight from before the flight brief to after the flight \ndebrief. \n \nDuring primary, you will be provided with both ground and flight CRM training.  Since research \nand development began in 1991, the CRM program and its seven skills have become fully \nintegrated into all aspects of naval aviation and are governed by OPNAVINST 1542.7 (series).  \nWith the instructor/student relationship required by the nature of primary flight training, it is \nimperative that both instructors and students actively practice good CRM to ensure that safety is \nmaintained at all times.  This should not preclude the instructors from ensuring students are able \nto perform as single-pilots, but should provide guidance to maintain safety in the cockpit. \n \n1. Sandbag Syndrome.  The sandbag syndrome is based on a comforting premise that one or \nmore other crew members have the situation under control and are looking out for your best \ninterest.  It is a direct breakdown of CRM skills such as:  leadership, assertiveness, and \nsituational awareness.  The sandbag syndrome is mainly experienced at certain times when the \ninstructor pilot has assumed flying duties, such as breaks in training, approaches, enroute \ntransits, etc.  This effectively results in the SNA being \"along for the ride.\"  It is important to \nremember that no pilot is above the momentary lapse of judgment or situational awareness that \ncould result in a flight violation or mishap.  Do not let this happen to you!  As a copilot, your \nprimary responsibility is to support and back up the pilot at the controls.  \n \nStay alert and be assertive when necessary.  The instructor/student relationship often fosters \nreluctance on the part of the SNA to confront the Instructor Pilot (IP).  But remember, do not let \nmisplaced professional courtesies stand in the way of maintaining safe and efficient flying \npractices.  \n \n2. \"I’m Safe\" Checklist.  As a rule, good aircrew coordination begins with the individual \ncrew member.  Our situational awareness resources might be lacking before we even set foot in \nthe cockpit.  Unfortunately, we do not have external readouts telling ourselves when they are \ndiminished.  Therefore, it is important that every pilot conduct a daily personal preflight prior to \neach flight.  \"I’M SAFE\" is a simple checklist to determine if we are ready and fit to fly.  Do not \nshow up for a brief without first conducting a personal preflight.  \n \n ",

PHYSICAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS \n \nTo help you understand something of the physical and psychological factors affecting your \ntraining, the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to paraphrasing our flight surgeon’s \nthoughts on the matter. \n \n1. Physical ease and relaxation while flying makes the difference between the pilot flying the \nplane and the plane flying the pilot.  A proper sense of \"feel\" of the aircraft is essential.  Just as a \ngood horseman must be sensitive to the movements of his mount, so must the aviator be sensitive \nto the movements of the airplane.  This innate sense cannot be achieved in any other way than by \nthe proper relaxation of all the body muscles and light touch on the aircraft’s controls.  The art of \nbeing relaxed in an airplane involves an awareness of what your body and mind are doing.  A \nnatural reaction to the strange environment or unusual situation is the age-old aviator tendency to \n\"pucker\" in a tight situation.  Be alert for involuntary tensing of the muscles and you will find \nyou quickly develop that sought-after \"feel\" and avoid the hard-to-break habit of mechanical \nflying.  An important aspect of developing this sense of \"feel\" is knowing what you are going to \ndo at all times and be prepared for the next evolution in your flight training.  This is nothing \nmore than knowing your PROCEDURES.  Remember the panic in your school days when you \nwere handed a test and it suddenly dawned on you that you had not studied, or what you had \nstudied was not on the test?  \n \n2. Mental attitude is a very essential element to your relaxation in an aircraft.  It affects your \nnervous system and, if allowed to continue in an unhealthy trend, can result in actual physical \nincapacitation.  Therefore, its significance should be fully appreciated.  As with physical \nhandicaps, any mental distraction will also detract from the full use of your required senses.  A \npoor mental attitude will interfere with your ability to concentrate, learn, and apply your \nknowledge.  In turn, a good or positive mental attitude will increase your learning capacity and \nwill make your flight training a pleasure rather than an unpleasant job. \n \nIf for any reason you find yourself \"flying more, and enjoying it less,\" whether from some \nknown cause or not, discuss it with your flight instructor or unit leader.  Another aid to acquiring \na positive mental attitude, after you have satisfied yourself that it is not an outside problem \naffecting you mentally, is to find some healthy diversion that will get your mind away from the \nsubject of flying for a time.  The base as well as the local area offers much in the way of \nrecreational opportunities and diversions.  \n \n ",

Mental alertness on the pilot’s part has a direct bearing upon safety of flight as well as \ncontributing significantly to the learning process.  Remember that the training areas utilized are \nnot very large and are used by many aircraft.  Being constantly on the alert while flying may \nsave your life and that of one of your squadron mates.  Mental laziness is the constant enemy of \nevery aviator.  So, as you progress through flight training, plan ahead and try to anticipate all \npossible contingencies that could affect the operation of your aircraft.  Proper planning not only \nrefers to the environment around you but also the aircraft in which you are sitting.  Check your \nengine instruments from time to time to ensure that all is well up front.  In other words, train \nyourself to be alert to all facets of your flight rather than concentrating on the problem of the \nmoment.  You will find yourself surprised at the amount of information your eyes will transmit \nto your brain during a quick SCAN of your surroundings.  Planning ahead will also equip you to \ntake immediate and appropriate action should an emergency occur.  \n \n4. Confidence in your aircraft, your instructor, and most importantly yourself, is another \nessential element of flying.  The basic ingredient to acquiring the confidence necessary to \nprofessionally pilot an aircraft is knowledge and efficient analytical application of that \nknowledge.  The aircraft you are flying has been engineered to provide you with every safety \nfeature known to the industry.  The risks beyond the control of the pilot are minimal.  Fire is an \nextremely rare occurrence.  Engines are inherently reliable.  In-flight collisions are rarities that \nare completely avoidable if you stay alert.  With the above points in mind, it is readily apparent \nthat the chance of an aviation accident caused by anything other than incompetence, \ndisobedience or poor judgment is remote.  Remember that 70% of all fatal accidents are due to \n100% pilot error.  With all this going for you, do not let human frailty or overconfidence \ndevelop, particularly while your experience is limited.  The instant that a pilot begins to lose that \nfeeling of respect due an aircraft, he has reached a stage when anything can happen and usually \ndoes.  Good pilots are never caught unprepared in an emergency situation.  They know and \nunderstand emergency procedures COLD!  Humble confidence and perseverance will go a long \nway in striving for those Wings of Gold.  \n \n5. Occasionally physiological problems arise during the course of a flight.  Airsickness, \nfatigue, hypoxia, food poisoning and dehydration can overcome a pilot and result in reduced \nsituational awareness and even complete incapacitation.  Pilots must not only recognize these \nsymptoms in themselves but also in other crew members.  At any time, the non-affected crew \nmember should be ready to take the controls, and if necessary, fly to a safer environment (i.e., \nhigher altitude, away from other aircraft and clouds) to include termination of the flight.  \nAirsickness is common during early Contact flights and, even though it is not usually \nincapacitating, it affects judgment and reduces situational awareness.  If this occurs, inform your \ninstructor.  \n \n111. FLIGHT SIMULATORS \n \nYou won’t always have a formal training device at your disposal to prepare for your simulators \nand flights.  “Chair flying” or “hangar flying” is an excellent way to prepare at home, preferably \nwith a classmate.  Strap your checklist on your knee, put on your gloves, grab a simulated control  \n \n ",

Visualize each procedural \nstep of your planned maneuvers and verbalize your radio calls.  “Chair flying” is a skill in itself \nand can reap major rewards in all phases of your training and throughout your career. \n \nSimulators have proven to be valuable assets in helping students learn the physical attributes \nnecessary to become a good pilot.  Before you climb into the T-6B aircraft for the first time, you \nwill have practiced the use of checklists, basic flight and emergency procedures several times.  \nThere are 3 types of simulators available for your use: a static trainer, Unit Training Device \n(UTD), and Operational Flight Trainer (OFT).  In addition to the syllabus training that you \nreceive in the UTD or OFT, you should utilize the static trainers at every opportunity.

INTRODUCTION \n \nPrior to your first flight in the T-6B, there are several fundamental topics that you should review \nand understand if you are to obtain maximum benefit from your primary training.  These topics \ninclude not only basic aerodynamics, but also certain principles pertaining to safety of flight.  \nWhile more complex theories were covered in the classroom during Aviation Indoctrination, the \nbasics are considered to be of sufficient importance to repeat in broad terms at this time.  The \ndiscussions in this chapter provide Student Naval Aviators with the basic factors of flight before \nactually beginning to fly.  \n \nIn addition, this chapter discusses the controls with which you will operate the aircraft about the \nthree axes of motion, and how to use them effectively. \n \n201. THEORIES OF FLIGHT \n \n1. Lift And Thrust.  Our discussion will include several basic laws of physics that help to \nexplain how an airplane flies.  Sir Isaac Newton is credited with having observed in 1687,\". . . \nfor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction . . .\" This principle applies whenever two \nobjects act upon each other, such as the air and the propeller, or the air and the wing of the \nairplane.  In short, the statement about \"action and reaction\" tells us how lift and propulsion of \nairplanes are produced.  \n \nThe predominant method by which air exerts force on a solid body, such as an airplane’s wing, is \nthrough pressure.  For our purposes, friction can be ignored.  In the 1700’s, Daniel Bernoulli (a \nSwiss mathematician) discovered the Venturi Principle.  He found that if the velocity of a fluid \n(air) is increased at a particular point, the static pressure of the fluid (air) at that point is \ndecreased.  The airplane’s wing is designed to increase the velocity of the air flowing over the \ntop of the wing as it moves through the air.  To do this, the top of the wing is curved, while the \nbottom is relatively flat.  The air flowing over the top travels a little farther (since it is curving) \nthan the air flowing along the flat bottom.  This means the air on top must go faster.  Hence, the \nstatic pressure decreases, resulting in a lower static pressure (as Bernoulli stated) on top of the \nwing and a relatively higher static pressure below.  The pressure differential then pushes the \nwing up towards the lower pressure area, i.e., LIFT.  To increase the lift, the wing is tilted \nupward in relation to the oncoming air (relative wind) to increase the deflection of air.  Relative \nwind during flight is the direction of the airflow in relation to the wing as it moves through the \nair.  The angle at which the wing meets the relative wind is called the angle of attack.   \n(Figure 2-1) \n \n \n \n \n \n  ",

This results in a swirling, turbulent flow of air \nover the wing and \"spoils\" the lift.  Consequently, the wing stalls.  On most types of airplanes, \nthis critical angle of attack is about 15-20°. \n \nWhen the propeller rotates, it provides the force to pull the airplane forward.  This forward \nmotion causes the airplane to act on the air to produce lift.  The propeller blades, just like a wing, \nare curved on one side and straight on the other side.  Hence, as the engine rotates the propeller, \nforces similar to those of the wing create \"lift\" in a forward direction.  This is called thrust.  \n \nUp to this point, the discussion has related only to the \"lifting\" force.  Before an understanding of \nhow an airplane flies is complete, other forces must be discussed.  \n \n2. Gravity.  While the airplane is propelled through the air and sufficient lift is developed to \nsustain it in flight, there are certain other forces acting at the same time.  Every particle of matter, \nincluding airplanes, is attracted downward towards the center of the earth by gravitational force.  \nThe amount of this force on the airplane is measured in terms of weight.  If the airplane is to \nkeep flying, lift must overcome its weight or gravitational force.  \n \n3. Drag.  Another force that constantly acts on the airplane is drag.  Drag is the resistance \ncreated by air particles striking and flowing around the airplane when it is moving through the \nair.  Aircraft designers constantly try to streamline wings, fuselages and other components to \nreduce the rearward force of drag as much as possible.  The portion of drag caused by form \nresistance and skin friction is termed parasite drag, since it is not the result of the production of \nlift. \n ",

      "text": "PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER TWO \n \nT-6B AERODYNAMICS AND FLIGHT CONTROLS    2-3 \nA second part of the total drag force is caused by the wing’s lift.  As the wing deflects air to \nproduce lift, the total lift force is not exactly vertical, but is tilted slightly rearward.  This means \nthat it causes some rearward drag force.  This drag is called induced drag, and is the price paid to \nproduce lift.  The larger the angle of attack, the more the lift force on the wing tilts towards the \nrear and the larger the induced drag becomes.  To give the airplane forward motion, thrust must \novercome drag.  \n \nIn a steady flight condition (no change in speed or flight path), forces that oppose each other are \nalso equal to each other and are always present.  That is, lift equals weight, and thrust equals \ndrag. \n \n4. Centrifugal Force.  Still yet another force that frequently acts on the airplane is centrifugal \nforce.  However, this force occurs only when the airplane is turning or changing the direction \n(horizontally or vertically) of the flight path.  Another of Newton’s laws of energy states that \"a \nbody at rest tends to remain at rest, and a body in motion tends to remain moving at the same \nspeed and in the same direction . . . \" Thus, to make an airplane turn from straight flight, a \nsideward inward force must act upon it.  The tendency of the airplane to keep moving in a \nstraight line and outward from a turn is the result of inertia and it produces centrifugal force.  \nTherefore, some impeding force is needed to overcome centrifugal force so that the airplane \nmoves in the desired direction.  The lift of the wings provides this counteracting force when the \nairplane’s wings are banked in the desired direction.  Refer to the section on Turns in chapter \nthree. \n \nSince the airplane is in a banked attitude during a properly executed turn, the pilot will feel the \ncentrifugal force by increased seat pressure, rather than the feeling of being forced to the side as \nis experienced in a rapidly turning automobile.  The amount of force (G force) felt by seat \npressure depends on the angle of bank.  The pilot will, however, be forced to the side of the \nairplane (as in an automobile) if a turn is improperly made and the airplane is made to slip or \nskid.  \n \n5. Yaw Forces.  One other force which affects the aircraft during certain conditions of flight \nand which will be frequently referred to in the discussions on various flight maneuvers is torque \neffect or \"left turning tendency.\"  It is probably one of the least understood forces that affect an \naircraft in flight.  Torque effect is the force which causes the airplane to have a tendency to \nswerve (yaw) to the left, and is created by the clockwise rotation of the engine and the propeller.  \nThere are four factors that contribute to this yawing tendency:  \n \na. Torque reaction to the engine and propeller. \n \nb. The propeller’s gyroscopic effect. \n \nc. The corkscrewing effect of the propeller slipstream. \n \nd. The asymmetrical loading of the propeller (P-factor). \n \nIt is important that pilots understand why these factors contribute to torque effect.  ",

(Figure 2 -2) Torque reaction in a propeller-driven aircraft acts \nopposite the direction of propeller rotation.  In the case of the T-6B, the aircraft tends \nto roll to the left as a result of torque when power is increased, and the aircraft tends \nto roll right when power is reduced.

(Figure 2-3) Gyroscopic reactions are called gyroscopic \nprecession.  This occurs when a force is applied to displace a spinning mass such as \nthe propeller or, in the case of a spin, the aircraft as a whole.  Gyroscopic precession \ncauses an applied force to act in a plane 90° from that in which it was applied (it is \napplied in the same direction as the rotation).  The effect of gyroscopic precession \ndepends on the rate of movement about the pitch or yaw axis.  Increased rotation rates \ntend to increase the effect.  This explains why a pilot, who abruptly corrects aircraft \ndeviations (pitch, bank, and yaw), ends up frustrated with the adverse effects of \nprecession.  The relatively large propeller on the T-6B and high revolutions per \nminute (rpm) result in more precession effect than an aircraft with a lighter, smaller \npropeller turning at slower rpm.  Typical reactions from a clockwise-turning propeller \n(as viewed from the pilot’s seat) include: \n \n- If the nose is yawed to the left, the nose tends to pitch up. \n \n- If the nose is yawed to the right, the nose tends to pitch down. \n \n- If the nose is pitched down, a left yaw tends to develop. \n \n- If the nose is pitched up, a right yaw tends to develop. \n ",

Slipstream Effect (Figure 2-4).  The thrust generated by the rotation of the propeller \ninduces a phenomenon called corkscrew slipstream effect.  Specifically, the rotating \nprop produces a helical (or corkscrew) shaped air stream about the longitudinal axis.  \nThis slipstream strikes the wing root, fuselage, and tail surfaces with a constant high-\nenergy force proportional to power setting and airspeed.  The addition of power \nincreases airflow over the tail surfaces and makes them more effective at slow speeds.  \nIn the T-6B, the corkscrew slipstream induces a slightly higher angle of attack (AOA) \non the left wing root and left tail surfaces, and slightly lowers AOA on the right wing \nroot and right tail surfaces.  This causes the aircraft to yaw to the left when power is \nincreased, and requires right rudder input to counter the yaw and maintain \ncoordinated flight.  As the power is increased by moving the power control lever \n(PCL) forward with the left hand, the right foot must move forward to counter the \nyaw that is induced to the left.  The amount of rudder movement is proportional to the \namount and rate of PCL movement.  The amount and rate of rudder movement can be \ndetermined by looking out the front of the aircraft and using the rudder to keep the \nnose from swinging either left (too little rudder application) or right (too much rudder \napplication).  A power reduction has the opposite effect, requiring left rudder to \nmaintain coordinated flight. \n \n",

P-Factor (Figure 2-5).  P-factor is another effect of the propeller.  It is caused by \nAOA being higher on the downward moving propeller blade than on the upward \nmoving propeller blade.  This occurs when the aircraft’s thrust line is above the free \nair stream relative wind or at low speeds and high angles of attack with power-on.  \nThis moves the aerodynamic center of the propeller to the right of the shaft on a \nclockwise-rotating propeller, causing the aircraft to yaw left as AOA or power is \nincreased.  This is why increasing right rudder is required to maintain coordinated \nflight as angle of attack is increased on the aircraft, such as in a pull-up for an over-\nthe-top aerobatic maneuver.  As the airspeed decreases and the AOA increases, the \naerodynamic center of the propeller shifts to the right and right rudder is required to \nkeep the aircraft in coordinated flight.  The opposite is true when the thrust line is \nbelow the free air stream relative wind.  The upward-moving propeller blade then has \na higher angle of attack than the downward-moving blade.  This moves the \naerodynamic center of the propeller to the left of the shaft on a clockwise-rotating \npropeller, causing the aircraft to yaw to the right and requires left rudder to maintain \ncoordinated flight.

STABILITY AND CONTROL \n \nMost types of naval aircraft have been designed with satisfactory handling qualities in addition to \nadequate performance.  In particular, the T-6B is stable enough to maintain uniform flight \nconditions, recover from disturbances (such as turbulence), and minimize pilot workload.  It has \nsufficient controllability to achieve the desired performance.  However, there are certain \nconditions of flight which produce the most critical requirements of stability and control.  These \nconditions must be understood and respected to accomplish safe and efficient operation of the \naircraft.  \n \n1. Static Stability.  Besides being supported in flight by lift and propelled through the air by \nthrust, an airplane is free to revolve or move around three axes.  These axes may be thought of as \naxes around which the airplane revolves much like a wheel does.  Each axis is perpendicular to \nthe other two and all three intersect at the airplane’s center of gravity (CG).  The point around \nwhich the airplane’s weight is evenly distributed or balanced is considered the CG of the \nairplane.

This tendency will be to (a) return, (b) be displaced further, or (c) remain in the new \nattitude or position.  This initial tendency is known as static stability.  If the aircraft tends to \nmove back in the direction of its trimmed attitude, it is said to be statically stable or to have \npositive static stability.  If the aircraft continues to move away from trimmed equilibrium, it is \nstatically unstable or it has negative stability.

A \npendulum that is pushed to one side and released displays the same action.  The resulting motion \nis an oscillation (movement from one side of the equilibrium point to the other) until friction \ndamps out the motion. \n \nYour instructor will demonstrate the stability characteristics of the T-6B aircraft by trimming for \nstraight and level balanced flight.  He will then place the aircraft in various attitudes and permit \nthe aircraft to return to straight and level balanced flight, demonstrating the necessity and ease of \nproper use of trim.  As discussed earlier in this chapter, the T-6B is capable of equilibrium flight \nin all airspeeds and configurations that you will encounter.  That is, for all changes in power, \nairspeed, and configurations, the aircraft is able to maintain a \"hands-off\" straight and level \nbalanced flight condition, but will require a CHANGE IN TRIM SETTING for those changes.  \nFurther discussion on the use of trim will occur later in this chapter.  \n \nAn aircraft is said to be trimmed if all moments in pitch, roll, and yaw are equal to zero.  The \nestablishment of equilibrium at various conditions of flight is the function of the controls and \nwill be accomplished by pilot effort and trim tabs.  Pilot effort is necessary to establish \nequilibrium conditions and trim tabs will be used to hold the desired conditions (i.e., reduce \ncontrol pressure).  During training, trim will be of extreme importance and trimming rapidly and \nproperly will become a habit.  The necessity to trim the T-6B cannot be overemphasized.  When \nall of the pilot’s energy is consumed fighting the controls, little is left over for flying the aircraft \nand maintaining situational awareness.  \n \nControl.  Control is concerned with the maneuverability of the aircraft.  Although the T-6B \naircraft is \"inherently stable\" due to its positive and static and dynamic stability, it is not so stable \nas to inhibit aircraft maneuverability.  Since the T-6B is a primary trainer, it was designed to \nhave controls capable of aerobatic flight, yet not so sensitive as to make the aircraft difficult to \ncontrol or allow aircraft limits to be easily exceeded.  Generally speaking, control forces are \nhighest in the directional axis (ailerons).  The magnitude of these forces varies depending on the \nairspeed, trim setting and the amount of deflection.  At higher speeds, controls become difficult \nto deflect due to higher dynamic pressure impinging on the control surfaces.  Although the \nhigher dynamic pressure makes the controls more effective, resulting in a greater aircraft reaction \nfor a given control deflection, the forces required to obtain that control deflection are higher.  \nTrim setting affects control forces in that the further the aircraft is flown from its trimmed \nairspeed, the greater the forces required (in all axes) to maintain balanced flight conditions.  \nThese forces serve as physical cues to the pilot that the aircraft has deviated from its trimmed \nairspeed.  \n \n203. S TALLS \n \nIn earlier discussions it was shown that an airplane would fly as long as the wing is creating \nsufficient lift to counteract the load imposed on it.  When the lift is completely lost the airplane \nstalls.  Remember that the direct cause of every stall is an excessive angle of attack.  There are a \nnumber of flight maneuvers which may produce an increase in the angle of attack, but the stall \ndoes not occur until the angle of attack becomes excessive. \n ",

However, a given airplane will always stall at the same angle of attack \nregardless of airspeed, weight, load factor, or density altitude.  Each airplane has a particular \nangle of attack where the airflow separates from the upper surface of the wing and the stall \noccurs.  Each airplane has only one specific angle of attack where the stall occurs.  The airplane \ncan be stalled in straight and level flight by flying too slowly.  As the airspeed is being \ndecreased, the angle of attack must be increased to retain the lift required for maintaining \naltitude.  The slower the airspeed becomes, the more the angle of attack must be increased.  \nEventually an angle of attack is reached which will result in the wing not producing enough lift \nto support the airplane and it will start settling.  If the airspeed is reduced further, the airplane \nwill stall since the angle of attack has exceeded the critical angle and the airflow over the wing is \ndisrupted. \n \nIn naval aviation, there is great importance assigned to precise control of an aircraft at high angle \nof attack conditions.  Safe operation in carrier aviation demands the ultimate in precision flying \nat low airspeed.  The aerodynamic lift characteristics of an airplane must be fully understood by \nthe Student Naval Aviator  as well as the seasoned \"fleet pilot\" for obvious safety reasons.  \nAdditionally, mission requirements and their execution may depend on the pilot’s own \ncapabilities and grasp of these basic concepts. \n \nDuring flight maneuvers, landing approach, takeoff, etc. the airplane will stall IF THE \nCRITICAL ANGLE OF ATTACK IS EXCEEDED.  The airspeed at which stall occurs will \nbe determined by weight, load factor, altitude, and configuration, but the stall angle of attack \nremains unaffected.  At any particular altitude, the indicated stall speed is a function of weight \nand load factor.  An increase in altitude will produce a decrease in density and an increase in true \nairspeed.  Also, an increase in altitude will alter compressibility and airflow viscosity, which will \ncause the indicated stall speeds to increase. \n \nModern airplanes are characterized by having a large percentage of their maximum gross weight \nas fuel.  Most Navy inventory aircraft carry 25-40% of their total gross weight in this manner.  \nHence, the gross weight and stall speed of the airplane can vary considerably throughout the \nflight.  A general \"rule of thumb\" is that a 2% change in weight will cause a 1% change in stall \nspeed. \n \nLoad factor/centrifugal force.  Turning flight and maneuvers produce an effect on stall speed, \nwhich is similar to the effect of weight.  The stalling speed of an airplane is higher in a level turn \nthan in straight and level flight.  This is because centrifugal force is added to the airplane’s \nweight, and the wing must produce sufficient additional lift to counterbalance the load imposed \nby the combination of centrifugal force and weight.  In a turn, the necessary additional lift is \nacquired by applying back pressure to the elevator control.  This increases the wing’s angle of \nattack, and results in increased lift.  As stated earlier, the angle of attack must increase as the \nbank angle increases to counteract the increasing load caused by centrifugal force.  If at any time \nduring a turn the angle of attack becomes excessive, the airplane will stall.  Thus, the aircraft in a \nsteady turn still develops lift greater than weight, but experiences increased stall speeds due to \nload factor increases.  This fact emphasizes the need to avoid steep turns at low airspeeds - a \nflight condition common to stall/spin accidents.  (Refer to NATOPS V\nn Diagram.) ",

The wing can be \nbrought into an excessive angle of attack at any speed.  For example, take the case of an airplane \nwhich is in a dive with an airspeed of 200 KIAS, when suddenly the pilot pulls back sharply on \nthe elevator control.  Because of gravity and centrifugal force, the airplane could not \nimmediately alter its flight path, but would merely change its angle of attack abruptly from quite \nlow to very high.  Since the flight path of the airplane, in relation to the oncoming air, determines \nthe direction of the relative wind, the angle of attack is suddenly increased, and the airplane will \nquickly reach the stalling angle at a speed much greater than normal stall speed.  \n \nThe primary purpose of high lift devices (i.e., flaps, slats, and slots) is to increase the coefficient \nof lift and reduce the stall speed for an airplane.  Therefore, flap extension increases the total lift \navailable and reduces the angle of attack for any given lift coefficient.  \n \nAt this point we should examine the action of the airplane during a stall.  In our earlier \ndiscussion of pitching (longitudinal) stability, we learned that to balance the airplane \naerodynamically, the center of lift is normally located aft of the center of gravity.  It should be \nnoted that although this airplane is inherently \"nose heavy,\" downwash on the horizontal \nstabilizer counteracts this condition.  It can be seen then, that at the point of stall when the \nupward force of the wing’s lift and the downward tail force cease, an unbalanced condition \nexists.  This allows the airplane to pitch down abruptly, rotating about its center of gravity. \nDuring this nose down attitude, the angle of attack decreases and the airspeed again increases; \nhence, the smooth flow of air over the wing begins again, lift returns, and the airplane is again \nflying.  However, considerable altitude may be lost before this cycle is complete.  \n \nThe associated loss of altitude and control response in the stalled configuration has meant the \nlives of both students and seasoned naval aviators.  A stall never checks anyone’s logbook or \nqualifications before it decides to happen.  Therefore, it is important to remember that the stall is \nnot merely a precision maneuver, but an actual situation into which you may inadvertently fly \nwhile concentrating on some other aspect of your flying. \n \n204. PRIMARY FLIGHT CONTROLS  \n \nTo maneuver an aircraft, you will learn to control its movement about its lateral, longitudinal, \nand vertical axes (Figure 2-9).  This is accomplished by the use of the flight controls (elevators, \nailerons, and rudder), which can be deflected from their neutral position into the flow of air as \nthe aircraft moves forward.  In flight, the controls have a natural live “feel” due to the force of \nthe airflow around them.  With this in mind, the student should think of exerting force against \nthis live pressure or resistance not of moving the flight controls. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  ",

They form the rear part of \nthe horizontal stabilizer, are free to be moved up and down by the pilot, and are connected to a \ncontrol stick in the cockpit by means of cables and pulleys.  Applying forward pressure on the \nstick causes the elevator surfaces to move downward.  The flow of air striking the deflected \nelevator surfaces exerts an upward force, pushing the aircraft’s tail upward and the nose \ndownward.  Conversely, exerting back pressure on the control causes the elevator surfaces to \nmove up, exerting a downward force to push the tail downward and the nose upward.  In effect, \nthe elevators are the angle-of-attack (AOA) control.  When back pressure is applied on the \ncontrol, the tail lowers and the nose rises, thus increasing the wing’s AOA and lift.  \n \nAilerons \n \nThe ailerons control the aircraft’s movement about its longitudinal axis (Figure 2-10).  There are \ntwo ailerons, one at the trailing edge of each wing, near the wingtips.  They are movable surfaces \nhinged to the wing’s rear spar and are linked together by cables so that when one aileron is \ndeflected down, the opposite aileron moves up.  The ailerons are statically mass balanced with \nweights installed on the leading edges of each aileron.  \n \nThe two wings produce differences in the lift that actually turns the aircraft.

This happens because the downward deflection of the right aileron changes the wing \ncamber and increases the AOA and lift on that wing.  Simultaneously, the left aileron moves \nupward and changes the effective camber, resulting in a decreased AOA and less lift.

As right aileron pressure is applied, the airplane rolls into a right bank and tries to turn to \nthe right.  But the adverse yaw, or the drag on the downward deflected left aileron, pulls the \nairplane’s nose to the left.  The airplane banks, but it turns hesitantly and sideslips.  This is \nundesirable and corrective action should be taken by applying right rudder pressure. \n \nWhen right rudder pressure is applied simultaneously with right aileron pressure, it keeps the \nairplane from yawing opposite to the desired direction of turn.  In fact, the rudder must be used \nbecause the ailerons were used.  Coordinated use of the rudder with the ailerons in a turn will \ncounteract the effects of adverse yaw. \n \nAdverse yaw is an undesirable effect, and is most apparent at low speeds and extreme control-\nsurface deflections.  At faster airspeeds, adverse yaw becomes less apparent and may be \nunnoticeable.  When accomplishing slow flight, watch closely for the effects of adverse yaw in \nthe turn.  Your instructor can share methods on how to appropriately use the rudder while \ninitiating a turn to counter adverse yaw effects. \n \nRudder.  The rudder controls the aircraft’s movement about its vertical axis.  This motion is \ncalled yaw.  Like the other primary control surfaces, the rudder is a movable surface hinged to a \nfixed surface in this case to the vertical stabilizer.  Left and right rudder pedals control rudder \nmovement.  Its action is much like that of the elevators, except the motion is side to side instead \nof up and down.  When the rudder is deflected to one side, it protrudes into the airflow, causing a \nhorizontal force to be exerted in the opposite direction.  This pushes the tail of the aircraft in that \ndirection and yaws the nose in the desired direction.  For example: when the rudder is deflected \nto the left, it protrudes into the airflow on the left side of the tail, causing a horizontal force to be \nexerted on the tail to the right.  This pushes the tail of the aircraft to the right and yaws the nose \nto the left. \n \nThe primary purpose of the rudder in flight is to counteract the effect of adverse yaw and to help \nprovide directional control of the airplane.  In flight, the rudder does not turn the airplane; \ninstead, the force of the horizontal component of wing lift turns the airplane when the wings are \nbanked.  As in the demonstration of turning by use of ailerons alone, this can be verified by \nflying straight and level and then, after taking the hands off the control stick, trying to turn to the \nright by applying right rudder pressure only.  At first it may seem to work pretty well.  The \nairplane will turn to the right, but it will also skid to the left (a skid in a turn is an unbalanced \nflight condition caused by insufficient angle of bank for a given radius of turn).  Since the \nairplane possesses inherent stability, it will tend to stop the skid by banking itself to the right. \n \nIf the pilot were now to neutralize the rudder, only a shallow banking turn would result.  \nHowever, inasmuch as the purpose of this demonstration is to make a turn using only the rudder, \ncontinue to hold right rudder pressure.  Since the airplane is slightly banked to the right, the \nrudder will force the nose of the airplane downward to the right.  The reason for this is that \nyawing is the only movement the rudder can produce.  As a result, the nose yaws downward, the \nairspeed increases, and the airplane starts losing altitude.  At the same time, the airplane, being \nstable, attempts to stop the increased skidding by banking more steeply.  The more steeply it \nbanks, the more the nose is yawed downward by the right rudder action.  The net result of ",

Thus, it can \nbe seen that rudder alone cannot produce a balanced turn.  Coordinated application of aileron, \nrudder, and elevator pressure will produce a balanced flight condition. \n \nOn the ground, the T-6B rudder pedals manipulate the nose wheel steering (if engaged), which is \nused to directionally control the aircraft while taxiing.  Taxiing will be discussed in greater detail \nin Chapter Four, Ground Procedures. \n \nPrimary Control Application.  The following will always be true in controlled flight, \nregardless of the airplane’s attitude in relation to the earth:  \n \n1. When backpressure is applied to the elevator control, the airplane’s nose rises in relation to \nthe pilot.  \n \n2. When forward pressure is applied to the elevator control, the airplane’s nose lowers in \nrelation to the pilot.  \n \n3.

When pressure is applied to the right rudder pedal, the airplane’s nose moves to the right in \nrelation to the pilot.  \n \n6. When pressure is applied to the left rudder pedal, the airplane’s nose moves to the left in \nrelation to the pilot.  \n \n205. SECONDARY FLIGHT CONTROLS - TRIM DEVICES  \n \nThe secondary flight controls include electrically actuated pitch/roll/yaw trim systems and a \nrudder trim aid device (TAD).  The secondary flight controls are used for trimming and \nbalancing the aircraft in flight and to reduce the force required to actuate the primary flight \ncontrol surfaces.  \n \nTrimming the aircraft is an essential skill for you to master and its importance is often \noverlooked by fledging aviators.  When an aircraft’s flight conditions (attitude, power, airspeed, \nloading and configuration) are changed, the control pressures required to maintain the desired \nconditions are affected by the resulting changes in aerodynamic forces.  The T-6B is equipped \nwith systems that allow you to trim the aircraft for balanced flight in all axes.  \n \nTrim System and Switches  \n \nThe elevator and aileron trim are utilized by a thumb-actuated switch (Figure 2-12) at the top of \nthe control stick (fore/aft for elevator trim and laterally for aileron trim).  The rudder trim switch \nis located on the forward side of the power control lever (PCL).  To trim, deflect the trim switch ",

When \nperfectly “trimmed,” you can release flight control pressures (momentarily) and the aircraft will \nremain in its current balanced state.  The Trim Interrupt button on the control stick will remove \nelectrical power from the trim devices and is used during certain trim malfunctions.  The general \nsequence for trimming the aircraft is: Rudder, Elevator and then Aileron.  The rudder trim is \nusually first because a correction for yaw precipitates a change in the trim setting for pitch and \nroll.  Consequently, not trimming the rudder first will generally cause you to go back and re-trim \nthe elevator and aileron after trimming the rudder. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2-12  Control Stick \n \nRudder trim: an electromechanical actuator located in the vertical stabilizer, which drives an \nanti-servo trim tab on the trailing edge of the rudder provides rudder trim.

For example, if the ball is out to the right, the nose is actually out to the left and you \nare in unbalanced flight.  Smoothly apply right rudder pressure (“Step On The Ball”) to regain \nbalanced flight.  Then smoothly apply right rudder trim until you relieve the rudder pressure you \nare holding.  If you have trimmed properly, the ball should stay in the center and you should feel \nas if you are flying straight and level. \n \nTAD:  the rudder TAD of the T-6B assists in trimming about the yaw axis of the aircraft.  The \ninputs to the TAD include engine torque, altitude, airspeed, and pitch rate.  Based on these \ninputs, the TAD sends a signal to the rudder trim actuator physically moving the trim tab surface \nto a computed position.  Although the TAD is effective at approximating a valid rudder trim \nposition, it by no means replaces the need to appropriately trim the rudder, especially during \nrapid accelerations and large power changes. \n \n \n ",

Thus, a good method during minor trim changes is to allow the TAD to complete its \ntrim cycle, then make fine adjustments as necessary.  Loss of the TAD in flight does not affect \nthe overall controllability of the aircraft and its loss would minimally impact most training \nmissions.  \n \nElevator trim: elevator trim is provided by an electromechanical actuator which drives a tab \nsurface on the right side of the elevator.  To trim the aircraft nose attitude, first move the stick to \nposition the nose for the attitude you desire in relationship to the horizon.  As the fore/aft stick \nforce increases, maintain the desired nose attitude and apply elevator trim in the opposite \ndirection as the control pressure until it is relieved.  Always use a light grip on the stick so as to \n“feel” the pressure.  “Finger-tip control” is the key to smooth flying.  \n \nAileron trim:  the aileron trim is utilized much like the elevator trim but about the longitudinal, \nor roll, axis of the aircraft.  Interestingly, unlike the other two trim systems that utilize trim tab \nsurfaces on their training edges (rudder and elevator), aileron trim in the T-6B is accomplished \nby physical movement of the ailerons.  Ground adjustable trim tabs are installed on the trailing \nedge of each aileron to allow maintenance personnel to adjust the “neutral” setting.  Aileron trim \nis only necessary if, after the rudder is trimmed, the aircraft tends to roll to one side.  \n \n206. TRIM REQUIREMENTS - RUDDER/ELEVATOR \n \nAcceleration LEFT/DOWN \nDeceleration RIGHT/UP \nPower Addition RIGHT/DOWN \nPower Reduction LEFT/UP \n \nWhen airspeed is increased (with power unchanged), the nose will have a tendency to rise and \nthe aircraft will yaw slightly to the right; consequently, we need to add left (rudder) and down \n(nose down) trim.  If power is unchanged and airspeed is reduced, we see from the box above \nthat right rudder trim and up elevator trim is needed.  If airspeed is constant and power is \nincreased, then right rudder trim and down elevator trim is needed.  If power is reduced with \nairspeed constant, then left rudder trim and up elevator trim are necessary.  \n \nAside from these four basic scenarios, many flight maneuvers combine two of the “rules” \nsimultaneously.  For example, when initiating a 180 knot climb from normal cruise (200 knots, \nlevel), you add power, raise the nose, and decelerate.  In this case, right rudder trim is required \nfor both the power addition and deceleration.  However, the requirement conflicts on what to do \nwith the elevator (power addition = nose down/deceleration = nose up).  In this example, trim \n“nose up” because, generally speaking, in opposing situations such as this one, airspeed will \nhave a greater and more lasting effect on the elevator and rudder trim.  Therefore, as a common \ntrim rule, “Airspeed trumps Power.”  \n \n ",

PERFORMANCE \n \nRemember this simple formula:  POWER + ATTITUDE = PERFORMANCE  \n \nMost early basic air work problems result from the inability to properly see and control the \naircraft’s attitude, in correlation to the power applied by the engine.  Only after you master \nproper attitude control will you begin to develop solid basic flying skills.  \n \nCoordinated use of all controls is very important in any turn.  Applying aileron pressure places \nthe aircraft in the desired angle of bank (AOB), while simultaneous application of rudder \npressure is required to counteract the resultant adverse yaw.  During a turn, the AOA must be \nincreased by adding back-stick pressure (increasing elevator deflection) to compensate for the \nloss of lift due to bank.  Thus, the steeper the turn, the more back elevator pressure is needed to \nmaintain level flight, accompanied by a corresponding increase in G load.  Varying greatly \namong different flight regimes, the actual amount of deflection of the control surfaces is of little \nimportance as long as you reach the desired result.  \n \nWhen using the rudder pedals, pressure should be applied smoothly and evenly by pressing with \nthe ball of one foot just as when using the brakes of an automobile.  The rudder pedals are \ninterconnected and act in opposite directions; when pressure is applied to one pedal, pressure on \nthe other must be relaxed proportionally.  For positioning, comfortably rest the balls of your feet \nagainst the lower portion of the rudder pedals while supporting the weight of your feet on the \ncockpit floor.  The pedals should be adjusted so that full throw is available with a slight flex in \nthe knee. \n \n208. POWER CONTROL LEVER \n \nThe PCL controls the power output of the engine (Figure 2-13).  This power, transmitted through \nthe propeller, produces thrust.  As discussed in the previous chapter, this thrust will propel the \naircraft through the air, developing lift.  When sufficient power is combined with the appropriate \nangle of attack, the desired performance is obtained. \n \nMoving the PCL forward increases power; moving it aft decreases power.  If a constant airspeed \nis maintained with adjustments in the attitude relative to the horizon, a variation in power will \ncontrol the gain or loss of altitude.  This concept of control establishes a basic fundamental of the \nmechanics of any powered flight. \n \nThe PCL should be operated firmly but smoothly.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThis section discusses and explains the fundamental flight maneuvers upon which all flying tasks \nand procedures are based.  In learning to fly, as in any learning process, fundamentals must be \nmastered before the more advanced phases can be learned.  \n \n301. FUNDAMENTAL FLIGHT MANEUVERS \n \nManeuvering of the airplane is generally divided into four flight fundamentals:  \n \n1. Straight and level flight \n \n2. Turns \n \n3. Climbs \n \n4. Descents \n \nAll controlled flight consists of any one or a combination of these basic maneuvers.  Proper \ncontrol of an airplane’s attitude is the result of the pilot knowing when and how much to change \nit, and then smoothly making the required correction.  When flying by reference to objects \noutside the airplane, the effects of the pilot’s control application on the airplane’s flight attitude \ncan be seen by observing the relationship of the position of some portion of the airplane to the \noutside references. \n \nAt first, control of the airplane is a matter of consciously fixing the relationship of a specific \nreference point on the airplane to the horizon.  As basic flight skills are developed through \nexperience and training, the pilot will acquire a continuous awareness of these relationships \nwithout conscious effort.  The reference points will be used almost subconsciously in varying \ndegrees to determine the attitude of the airplane during all maneuvers.  \n \nIn establishing the reference points, the airplane should be placed approximately in the desired \nattitude, and then a specific point should be selected.  No two pilots see this relationship exactly \nthe same.  The apparent position of reference points will depend on each pilot’s seat height and \nlateral position, and/or the pilot’s eye level and line of sight.  It is imperative that the student \nutilize the same seat position on each flight so that the reference points remain the same.  \n \n302.

It does, however, provide an excellent foundation for flight \nduring Instrument Navigation stage of training, and will result in the pilot becoming a more \naccurate, competent, and safe pilot.  \n \nA sharp lookout for other aircraft must be maintained at all times, particularly when using \ninstrument references, to avoid the possibility of a collision.  Frequently, other aircraft are \nunnoticed until they suddenly appear within the limited area of the pilot’s vision.  Consequently, \nit is imperative that the pilot not only divide attention between controlling the airplane by outside \nvisual references and flight instruments, but also be observant of other aircraft.  For visual flight, \nthe pilot’s scan should be directed outside the cockpit at least 80 - 90% of the time!  \n \n303. ATTITUDE FLYING \n \nAirplane control is composed of four components:  \n \n1. Pitch control:  Pitch control is the control of the airplane (longitudinal axis) about its \nlateral axis by applying elevator pressure to raise or lower the nose, usually in relation to the \nhorizon.  \n \n2. Bank control:  Bank control is the control of the airplane (lateral axis) about its \nlongitudinal axis by use of the ailerons to attain the desired angle of bank in relation to the \nhorizon.  \n \n3. Yaw control:  Yaw control is the control of the aircraft (longitudinal axis) about its vertical \naxis by use of the rudder.  \n \n4. Power control:  Power control is the control of power or thrust by use of the PCL to \nestablish or maintain desired airspeeds in coordination with the attitude changes.  \n \nThe Primary Flight Display (PFD) displays both the pitch and bank attitude of the aircraft and \nshows the aircraft’s direction of flight.  \n \n1.

Most midairs also involve maneuvers that are classified as \ncrossing or overtaking.  Very rarely are head-on collisions reported. \n \nIt is also noteworthy to find that the closing speed (rate at which two aircraft approach each \nother) in a crossing or overtaking maneuver is often relatively slow, usually much slower than \nthe airspeed of either aircraft involved.  Again, that is because the majority of midair collisions \nare the result of a faster aircraft overtaking and striking a slower one. \n \nStudies also reveal some interesting information regarding the vulnerabilities of the human eye \nand how its limitations contribute to midair collisions. \n \nThe eye, and consequently vision, is vulnerable to just about everything: dust, fatigue, emotion, \ngerms, fallen eyelashes, age, optical illusions and alcoholic content.  In flight, our vision is \naffected by atmospheric conditions, windscreen distortion, too much or too little oxygen, \nacceleration, glare, heat, lighting and aircraft design.  Most importantly, the eye is vulnerable to \nthe vagaries of the mind.  We \"see\" and identify only what the mind lets us see.  For example, a \ndaydreaming pilot staring into space sees no approaching traffic and is a number one candidate \nfor a midair collision. \n \nA constant problem source to the pilot (though he is probably never aware of it) is the time \nrequired for \"accommodation.\"  Our eyes automatically accommodate for (or focus on) near and \nfar objects.  But the change from something up close, like a dark panel two feet away, to a well-\nlighted landmark or an aircraft target a mile or so away, takes one to two seconds or longer for \neye accommodation.  That can be a long time when you consider that you need 10 seconds to  \navoid a midair collision. \n \nAnother focusing problem occurs on drab, colorless days above a haze or cloud layer when no \ndistinct horizon is visible.  If there is little or nothing to focus on, we do not focus at all.  We ",

The board concluded that this is also a causal \nfactor.  To actually accept what we see, we need to receive cues from both eyes.  If an object is \nvisible to one eye, but hidden from the other by a windscreen post or other obstruction, the total \nimage is blurred and not always accepted by the mind. \n \nAnother inherent eye problem is that of narrow field of vision.  Although our eyes accept light \nrays from an arc of nearly 200º, they are limited to a relatively narrow area (approximately  \n10-15º) in which they can actually focus on and classify an object.  Though we can perceive \nmovement in the periphery, we cannot identify what is there.  We tend not to believe what we \nsee out of the corner of our eyes.  This often leads to \"tunnel vision.\" \n \nThat limitation is compounded by the fact that at a distance, an aircraft on a collision course will \nappear to be motionless.  It will remain in a seemingly stationary position, without appearing \neither to move or to grow in size for a relatively long time, and then suddenly bloom into a huge \nmass filling the canopy.  This is known as \"blossom effect.\"  We need motion or contrast to \nattract our eyes’ attention.  A large bug smear or dirty spot on the windscreen can hide a \nconverging plane until it is too close to be avoided. \n \nIn addition to built-in problems, the eye is also severely limited by environment.  Optical \nproperties of the atmosphere alter the appearance of traffic, particularly on hazy days.  \"Limited \nvisibility\" actually means \"limited vision.\"  You may be legally Visual Flight Rules (VFR) when \nyou have three miles visibility, but at that distance, on a hazy day, opposing traffic is not easy to \ndetect.  At a range closer than three miles, even though detectable, opposing traffic may not be \navoidable.  \n \nLighting also affects our vision.  Glare, usually worse on a sunny day over a cloud deck or \nduring flight directly into the sun, makes objects hard to see and scanning uncomfortable.  Also, \na well-lighted object will have a high degree of contrast and be easy to detect, while one with \nlow contrast at the same distance may be impossible to see.  For instance, when the sun is behind \nyou, an opposing aircraft will stand out clearly, but when you are looking into the sun, and your \ntraffic is \"back-lighted,\" it is much more difficult to see. \n \nA contrast problem exists when trying to see an airplane against a cluttered background.  If an \naircraft is between you and terrain that is varied in color or heavily dotted with buildings, it will \nblend into the background until it becomes quite close. \n \nSo what can we do to overcome the vulnerabilities of the eye?  The most important thing is to \ndevelop a scan that is both comfortable and workable for your own airplane.  In normal flight, \nthe threat of a midair collision is greatly diminished by scanning an area 60º either side of center \nand 10º up and down.  Refer to Figure 3-1.  This does not mean that the rest of the area should be \nignored. \n  ",

Depending upon the mode selected, a series of traffic advisory \nsymbols (see T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual) may appear, enabling earlier visual detection of \npossible conflicting traffic.  In this way the TCAS effectively complements but does not replace \nthe VFR scan, which remains the pilot’s primary means to see and avoid conflicting traffic.  \n \nMany times the threat of an impending midair collision is evident early enough for the aircrew to \ndiscuss the threat and coordinate a decision regarding deviation from the flight path to avoid it. \nHowever, this will not always be the case.

In such a situation, students are expected to take the controls and/or initiate a \ndeviation in either bank, pitch or power (or combination of these) to displace the aircraft from its \ncurrent flight path in order to avoid the collision.  This concept holds true even if the deviation \ninvolves either high positive or negative \"G\" loads.  Avoiding the collision takes priority over \npreventing an overstress!

FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS \n \nOf the basic skills required for flight, instrument interpretation requires the most thorough study \nand analysis.  It begins with your understanding of each instrument’s construction and operating \nprinciples.  Then you must apply this knowledge to the performance of the aircraft you are \nflying, the particular maneuvers to be executed, the scan and control methods, and the flight \nconditions in which you are operating.  For each maneuver, you will learn what performance to  \nexpect and the combination of items that you must interpret in order to control aircraft attitude \nduring the maneuver. \n \n ",

There is a definite aerodynamic interrelationship between the rudder and aileron to \nmaintain balanced flight. \n \nFor an aircraft to be in a balanced flight condition, the controls must be applied so that the \nlongitudinal axis lies in the plane of forward motion.  The utilization of either the rudder or the \nailerons, independent of one another, will result in a condition of unbalanced flight.  The \"turn  \nand bank\" indicator indicates an unbalanced condition by moving away from the center position \nin the direction of the slip or skid.  The pilot can also recognize this condition by an awareness of \na sensation of side motion.  The side motion causes a tendency to lean in the direction of the slip \nor skid.  This unbalanced condition can be corrected by the proper application of the rudder, \nailerons, or both.  \n \n308. TURNS \n \nThe turn is the most complex of all the basic flight maneuvers.  During the turn, coordinated use \nof all three flight controls is required.  Although there are other important considerations, the \nfirst requirement for the turn is that balanced flight be maintained. \n \nYou will recall that when an airplane is flying straight and level, the total lift is acting \nperpendicular to the wings and to the earth.  As the airplane is banked into a turn, the lift then \nbecomes the resultant of two components.  One, the vertical component, continues to act \nperpendicular to the earth and opposes gravity.  The other, the horizontal component, acts \nparallel to the earth’s surface and opposes centrifugal force caused by the turn.  These two lift \ncomponents act at right angles to each other, causing the resultant lifting force to act \nperpendicular to the banked wings of the airplane.  It is this lifting force that actually turns the \nairplane, not the rudder. \n \nWhen applying aileron to bank the airplane, the depressed or lowered aileron (on the rising wing) \nproduces a greater drag than the raised aileron (on the lowering wing).  This increased aileron \ndrag, which is called adverse yaw, tends to yaw the airplane towards the rising wing, or opposite \nto the desired direction of turn, while the banking action is taking effect.  To counteract the \nyawing tendency, rudder pressure must be applied simultaneously in the desired direction of \nturn.  This produces a coordinated turn. \n \nAfter the bank has been established in a theoretically perfect turn in smooth air, all pressure on \nthe aileron control may be relaxed.  The airplane will remain at the bank selected with no further \ntendency to yaw since there is no longer a deflection of the ailerons.  As a result, pressure may \nalso be relaxed on the rudder pedals, and the rudder allowed to streamline itself with the \ndirection of the air passing it.  If pressure is maintained on the rudder after the turn is established, \nthe airplane will tend to skid to the outside of the turn.  If a definite effort is made to center the \nrudder rather than let it streamline itself to the turn, it is probable that some opposite rudder \npressure will be exerted inadvertently.  This would tend to force the airplane to yaw opposite its \noriginal turning path.  As a result, the airplane would tend to slip to the inside of the turn.  The  \n ",

This is required because the lift produced to equal \nthe weight of the airplane and the centrifugal force caused by the turn must be obtained from the \nwing to maintain altitude.  The force of lift must be further increased as the turn becomes steeper \nand the centrifugal force builds up, but must be slowly decreased as the airplane is being rolled \nback to level flight when completing the turn. \n \nTo stop the turn, the wings must be returned to laterally level flight by the use of the ailerons, \nand the resulting adverse yaw (now acting in the same direction as the turn), must be overcome \nby the coordinated application of rudder.  The yaw effect will often be more apparent when \nrolling out of a turn than rolling into a turn, due to the higher angle of attack and wing loading \nwhich exists when the rollout is started. \n \nTo understand the relationship between airspeed, bank, and radius of turn, it must be recalled that \nthe rate of turn at any given airspeed depends on the amount of sideward force causing the turn; \nthat is, the horizontal component.  The horizontal lift component varies in proportion to the \namount of bank.  Thus, the rate of turn at a given airspeed increases as the angle of bank is \nincreased.  On the other hand, when a turn is made at a higher airspeed for a given bank angle, \nthe centrifugal force created by the turn becomes greater, causing the turning rate to become  \n \n ",

It can be seen, then, that at a given angle of bank, a \nhigher airspeed will make the radius of the turn larger because the airplane will be turning at a \nslower rate.  \n \nThe inherent positive stability of the T-6B wing has an effect on the manner in which it turns.  \nTurns in the T-6B may be divided into three types: shallow, moderate, and steep.  Briefly, if a \nshallow angle of bank turn is established and the controls released, the aircraft tends to return to \nlevel flight.  This may not always occur, because friction in the control surface rigging may \ncause a very slight control deflection.  In a moderately banked turn, if the aileron and rudder \npressures are released, the aircraft will tend to stay at the established angle of bank.  In a steep \nangle of bank turn, the aircraft will tend to increase its bank.  The actual amount of angle of bank \nfor each type is undefined and varies with changes in airspeed and configuration. \n \nThe pilot’s posture while seated in the airplane is very important in all maneuvers, particularly \nduring turns as it affects the alignment of outside visual references.  At the beginning the student \nmay lean to the side when rolling into the turn in an attempt to remain upright in relation to the \nground rather than “ride” with the airplane.  This tendency must be corrected at the outset if the \nstudent is to learn to properly use visual references. \n \nAs in all maneuvering, the pilot should form the habit of ensuring that the area towards which a \nturn is to be made is clear of other aircraft.  If nearby aircraft are not detected before lowering the \nwing, it may be too late to avoid a collision.  \n \nAs soon as the airplane rolls from the wings-level attitude, the nose should also start to move \nalong the horizon, increasing its rate of travel proportionately as the bank is increased.  Any \nvariation from this will be indicative of the particular control that is being misused.  The \nfollowing variations provide excellent guides:  \n \n1. If the nose starts to move before the bank starts, rudder is being applied too soon.  \n \n2. If the bank starts before the nose starts turning, or the nose moves in the opposite direction, \nthe rudder is being used too late.  \n \n3. If the nose moves up or down when entering a bank, excessive or insufficient back elevator \npressure is being applied.  \n \nDuring all turns, the ailerons and rudder are used to correct minor variations just as they are in \nstraight-and-level flight.  However, during very steep turns, considerably more back elevator \npressure and trim is required to maintain altitude than in shallow and moderate turns, and \nadditional power may be needed to maintain a safe airspeed.  Frequently, there is a tendency for \nthe airplane’s nose to lower, resulting in a loss of altitude.  \n \nTo recover from an unintentional nose-low attitude during a steep turn, the pilot should first \nreduce the angle of bank with coordinated aileron and rudder pressure.  Then back elevator \npressure should be used to raise the airplane’s nose to the desired pitch attitude.  After  \n \n ",

Attempting to raise the nose \nfirst by increasing back elevator pressure will usually cause a tight descending spiral, and could \nlead to overstressing the airplane or stall. \n \n309. THE ONE-THIRD RULE \n \nSince the airplane will continue turning as long as there is any bank, the rollout must be started \nbefore reaching the desired heading.  The amount required to lead the heading will depend on the \nrate of turn and the rate at which the rollout will be made; however, a good rule of thumb is to \nstart the rollout one-third the number of degrees of angle of bank in use.  Example:  If a 30º angle \nof bank turn was being used, the rollout would be started 10º prior to the desired heading.  As the \nwings become level, the control pressures should be gradually and smoothly released so that the \ncontrols are neutralized as the airplane assumes straight-and-level flight.  As the rollout is being \ncompleted, attention should be given to outside visual references as well as the PFD to determine \nthat the wings are being leveled precisely and the turn stopped. \n \n310. SKID \n \nA skid occurs when the aircraft slides sideways away from the center of a turn.  It is caused by \ntoo much rudder pressure in relation to the angle of bank used.  In other words, if you try to force \nthe aircraft to turn faster without increasing its degree of bank, the aircraft will skid sideways \naway from its radius of turn.  In a turn, the rudder must follow the flight path of the aircraft.  If \nexcessive pressure is maintained on the rudder after the turn is established, a skid will result. \nFigure 3-5 shows a coordinated turn and a skid. \n \nA skid may also occur when you are flying in a level flight attitude if the nose of the aircraft is \npermitted to move sideways along the horizon when the wings are level.  This condition would \noccur when excessive rudder pressures are applied or when the aircraft is improperly trimmed.  \nA skidded turn can develop into a dangerous situation when in close proximity to the ground.  \nEssentially, what occurs is the wing on the inside of a turn is moving slower than the outside \nwing.  Since the slower wing develops less lift during a skid, this compounds the reduction in \nlift, eventually developing into a stall of one wing.  The result:  unintentional inverted flight!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

SLIP \n \nA slip occurs when the aircraft slides sideways towards the center of the turn.  It is caused by an \ninsufficient amount of rudder in relation to the amount of aileron and the angle of bank used.  If \nyou roll into a turn without using coordinated rudder and aileron, or if you hold rudder against \nthe turn after it has been established, the aircraft will slide sideways towards its center of turn.  A \nslip may also occur in straight and level flight if one wing is allowed to drag; that is, flying with \none wing low, while holding the nose of the aircraft straight by the use of the rudder pressure.  In \nthis case, the aircraft slips downward towards the earth’s surface and loses altitude.  An \nintentional slip is not a dangerous maneuver.  The slip is an acceptable method to safely dissipate \nexcess altitude under certain conditions discussed later in this manual.  Any inadvertent tendency \nto fly in an out-of-balanced flight (either a slip or skid) is NOT an acceptable practice.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

During a \nturn, balanced flight is maintained by causing the aircraft to move in a curve at a rate which is in \ndirect proportion to the degree of bank.  The angle of bank is established by the coordinated \napplication of ailerons and rudder.  The amount of rudder required to establish a turn is \ndependent upon the rate at which the angle of bank is established.  In other words, rolling into a \nturn rapidly requires more rudder than rolling into the same turn slowly.  This interrelationship is \nabsolute and should be thoroughly understood. \n \nThe overlapping function of the controls provides a safety factor in the control of the aircraft.  It \nis quite possible to fly the plane without the use of one or more controls.  For example, suppose \nthat the elevators failed to operate properly.  It is possible to control the position of the nose by \nthe use of power.  As the power is increased, the nose will rise; as the power is decreased, the \nnose will drop. \n \nIt is also possible to bank the airplane and to turn it without the use of the ailerons.  Using only \nthe rudder, the plane can be turned in any desired direction.  This use of the rudder will cause the \naircraft to yaw or skid in the direction in which the rudder is applied.  During the yawing motion, \nthe outside wing moves faster through the air than the inside wing.  This increases the lift of the \noutside wing, causing it to rise, thus producing a bank in the direction in which the rudder is \napplied.  A turn can also be accomplished by using only the ailerons.  In this instance, the aircraft \nwill have a tendency to slip before it begins to turn. \n \n ",

It must be emphasized, however, that smooth and balanced flight can only be achieved \nthrough the proper coordination of all controls.  You can also make it easy on yourself by \ntrimming the aircraft. \n \n312. WIND EFFECTS AND CRAB CORRECTIONS \n \nInasmuch as an aircraft flies in an air mass, any movement of this air mass affects the course of \nthe aircraft.  In other words, the path of the aircraft over the ground will be determined not only \nby the direction in which it is headed, but also by the direction and velocity of the air mass \nmovement.  In perfectly still air, for example, the nose of the aircraft points exactly in the same \ndirection as its path over the ground or, to put it another way, the path of the aircraft through the \nair and its path over the ground coincide.  However, you will notice the aircraft does not always \nfollow a course over the ground in the same direction the nose is pointed. \n \nYou have been or will be, at one time or another, flying parallel to a road or section line.  The \nlongitudinal axis of the aircraft is aligned perfectly with this road or section line and you are \nflying a straight and level course.  Suddenly, you realize that the aircraft is getting closer to the \nroad or has actually crossed it, without any turn having been made.  This would indicate to you \nthat the air in which you are flying is moving in a direction which has caused the aircraft to cross \nthe road at some angle. \n \nSuppose you were flying along straight and level and the wind was blowing 30 knots from a \ndirection 90º to your left.  At the end of one hour, the body of air in which you were flying would \nhave moved 30 miles to your right.  Since the aircraft was in the body of air, and moving with it, \nyou and the aircraft would also have drifted 30 miles to your right in one hour.  Of course, in \nrelation to the air mass itself, you would have moved forward only, but in relation to the ground, \nyou would have moved forward and 30 miles sideways.  This effect of the movement of the air \non the track of the aircraft is known as drift.  The difference between the actual heading of the \naircraft and its track over the ground is called the angle of drift.  Drift must be compensated for, \nin order to cause the aircraft to maintain a desired track over the ground.  The proper way to \ncorrect the drift when you are flying in straight and level flight and wish to follow a desired \nground track, is to make a shallow balanced turn into the wind.  When you seem to have the \ndrifting effect neutralized or stopped, return to straight and level flight.  The aircraft is now \npointed into the wind slightly.  This causes the aircraft to fly into the wind at the rate that the \nwind is trying to move it sideways.  Since the effect of drift has now been neutralized, the \naircraft will fly a straight and selected ground track.  The nose of the aircraft, however, is not \npointed in the direction of the ground track.  This is known as drift correction, and is usually \nreferred to as \"crabbing\" because the aircraft is moving sideways in relation to the ground  \n(Figure 3-7). \n \n \n \n \n \n  ",

CLIMBING FLIGHT \n \nFor an automobile to go uphill at the same speed as that being maintained on a level road, the \ndriver must \"step on the gas\"; that is, power must be increased.  This is because it takes more \nwork to pull the car’s weight up the hill and to maintain the same speed at which the car was \nmoving along the level road.  If the driver did not increase the power, the automobile might still \nclimb up the incline, but it would gradually slow down to a speed slower than that at which it \nwas moving on the level road. \n \nSimilarly, an airplane can climb at the cruise power setting with a sacrifice of speed, or it can, \nwithin certain limits, climb with added power and no sacrifice in speed.  Thus, there is a definite \nrelationship between power, attitude, and airspeed. \n \nWhen transitioning from level flight to a climb, the forces acting on the airplane go through \ndefinite changes.  After the addition of power, an increase in lift occurs when back pressure is \napplied to the elevator control.  This initial change is a result of the increase in the angle of \nattack, which occurs when the airplane’s pitch attitude is being raised.  This results in a climbing \nattitude.

To overcome this tendency and maintain a constant \nclimb attitude, additional back pressure must be applied to the elevator control. \n \nThe primary factor which affects an airplane’s ability to climb is the amount of excess power \navailable; that is, the power available above that which is required for straight-and-level flight. \n \nDuring the climb, lift will increase with the flight path, so that it is not directly opposing gravity \nto support the airplane’s weight.

Since weight is \nalways acting perpendicular to the earth’s surface and drag is acting in a direction opposite to the \nairplane’s flight path during a climb, it is necessary for thrust to offset both drag and gravity. \n \nAs the aircraft continues to climb at a constant angle of attack, torque will drop off as air density \ndecreases.  The volume of air entering the induction system gradually decreases, resulting in a \npressure reduction within the combustion chamber.  Consequently, power decreases.  The PCL \nmust be continually advanced to maintain constant power. \n \n314. CLIMBING TURNS \n \nIn developing skills to perform climbing turns, the following factors should be considered: \n \n1. With a constant power setting, the same pitch attitude and airspeed cannot be maintained in \na bank as in a straight climb, due to the decrease in effective lift during a turn. \n \n2. The degree of bank should be neither too steep nor too shallow.  Too steep a bank \nintensifies the effect mentioned above.  If too shallow, the angle of bank may be difficult to \nmaintain because of the inherent stability of the airplane. \n \n3. A constant airspeed, a constant rate of turn, and a constant angle of bank must be stressed. \nThe coordination of all controls is likewise a primary factor to be stressed and developed. \n \n4. The airplane will have a greater tendency towards nose-heaviness than in normal straight \nclimb, due to the decrease in effective lift that is the case in all turns. \n \n5. As in all maneuvers, attention should be diverted from the airplane’s nose and divided \namong all references equally. \n \nAll of the factors that affect the airplane during level (constant altitude) turns will affect it during \nclimbing turns or any other turning maneuver.  It will be noted that because of the low airspeed, \naileron drag (adverse yaw) will have a more prominent effect than it did in straight-and-level \nflight and more rudder pressure will have to be blended with aileron pressure to keep the airplane \nin coordinated flight during changes in bank angle.  Additional elevator deflection and trim will \nalso have to be used to compensate for centrifugal force and loss of vertical lift, and to keep the \npitch attitude constant. \n ",

If a medium or steep banked \nturn is used, the airplane will not climb sufficiently. \n \n315. DESCENDING FLIGHT \n \nWhen the power is reduced during straight and level flight, the thrust needed to balance the \nairplane’s drag is no longer adequate.  Due to the unbalanced condition, the drag causes a \nmomentary reduction in airspeed.  This decrease in speed, in turn, results in a corresponding \ndecrease in the wing’s lift.  The weight of the airplane now exceeds the force of lift so the \nresulting flight path is downward, with the force of gravity providing a portion of the forward \nthrust.  In effect, the airplane is actually going \"downhill.\" \n \nAs in entering a climb, the forces acting on an airplane again go through definite changes when \ntransitioning from level cruising flight to a descent.  When forward pressure is applied to the \nelevator control or the airplane’s pitch attitude is allowed to lower, the wing’s angle of attack is \ndecreased, the lift is reduced, and the flight path starts downward.  The initial reduction of the \nlift, which starts the airplane downward, is momentary.  When the flight path stabilizes, the angle \nof attack and lift stabilize. \n \n316. THE P.A.T. PRINCIPLE \n \nFor corrections and to execute many maneuvers you must:  \n \n1. Set/reset power \n \n2. Adjust the nose attitude \n \n3. Trim for the new attitude \n \nThe mechanics of the transitions will be performed in a specific sequence:  \n \n1. P ower \n \n2. A ttitude \n \n3. T rim \n \nAlthough power and attitude change are almost simultaneous, lead with PCL movement.  For \nexample, consider the transition to an enroute descent.  Reduce power from normal cruise to the \ndescent power setting, scanning the nose attitude.  As the power is retarded, lower the nose \ntowards a descending attitude.

ASSUMING CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT \n \nA most important flying safety requirement is a clear, positive understanding at all times of who \nhas control of the aircraft.  You must understand the procedures involved in transferring control \nof an aircraft. \n \nThe instructor will tell you over the intercommunications system (ICS), “I have the controls.”  \nWhen your instructor says, “I have the controls,” you acknowledge by stating over the ICS, “You \nhave the controls.”  You then take your hands and feet off the controls.  Your instructor will then \nconfirm control by saying, “I have the controls.”  Conversely, but in the same manner, when \nyour instructor wants you to fly, he/she will say, “You have the controls,” whereupon you will \ntake control and acknowledge over the ICS, “I have the controls.”  The instructor will then \ncomplete the exchange with another, “You have the controls.”  Keep flying the aircraft until you \nare told to do otherwise.  Understand that unless you and the instructor complete the 3-way \nexchange of controls, no exchange of control was made.  For example, your instructor may coach \nor aid your flare during a landing.  You may feel a presence on the control stick, but you are still \nflying and should continue to do so.  Never be in doubt as to who is flying; if you are not \nabsolutely sure, safety dictates you speak up and ask! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n \nThis chapter discusses the basic procedures essential to the safe operation of the airplane on the \nground prior to and after a flight.  This includes the major points of ensuring that the airplane is \nin an airworthy condition, starting and stopping the engine and taxiing the airplane to and from \nthe line area and the runway. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4-1  T-6B Taxiing \n \nIn the line area, there is usually considerable activity - aircraft may be operating at high power \nsettings, taxiing in and out of the area, taking off and landing on nearby runways; fuel trucks and \npeople may be moving about the aircraft.  Therefore, constant vigilance must be exercised while \nperforming ground operations. \n \nThe propeller is the most dangerous part of the airplane, since under certain light conditions it is \ndifficult to see a revolving propeller.  This may give the illusion that it is not there.  As a result, \nthe files of Aviation Safety Offices contain many cases that read, \"Victim walked into a rotating \npropeller.\" \n \nWhile approaching the airplane, the pilot should note the presence of obstructions and articles \nsuch as fire extinguishers, fueling or maintenance equipment, or chocks that could be a hazard \nwhen taxiing the airplane.

      "text": "CHAPTER FOUR  PRIMARY CONTACT \n4-2    GROUND PROCEDURES \n401. NAVAL AVIATION LOGISTICS COMMAND MAINTENANCE INFORMATION \nSYSTEM  \n \nThe Naval Aviation Logistics Command Maintenance Information System is the standard flight-\nwide maintenance system for aviation and used for T-6B maintenance.  It is a fully integrated, \ncomputerized system allowing input, tracking, and monitoring in real time.  This data is \nintegrated for the pilot in the Aircraft Discrepancy Book (ADB), which is a designated \nmaintenance binder for each T-6B aircraft on the line and is available at aircraft issue.  \nSpecifying that aircraft’s maintenance actions over its last ten flights, the ADB is primarily used \nfor pre-flight operations by aircrew to check the aircraft’s maintenance status.  Aircrews use an \nelectronic Maintenance Action Form (MAF) to document aircraft discrepancies.  The electronic \nMAF is used to ensure an accurate record is kept of all maintenance performed on an aircraft.  \nYour instructor will show you how to access this information. \n \nAll discrepancies are assigned either an UP or DOWN status.  A discrepancy assigned an UP \nstatus does not impair the safety-of-flight or mission capability of the aircraft.  An airplane may \nbe flown with outstanding (not yet corrected) UP write-ups or gripes, with no danger to the crew.  \nAn example of an UP gripe would be “paint peeling off leading edge of starboard wing just \nforward of the pitot tube.”  Notice the specific details used in this example.  Detailed discrepancy \nreports foster a closer working relationship between aircrew and maintenance and save both time \nand money. \n \nA discrepancy assigned a DOWN status immediately “downs” the aircraft until it is fixed.  You \nmust be able to interpret an outstanding MAF and determine whether the aircraft is safe for \nflight.  Besides any uncorrected write-ups, discrepancies recorded over the past ten flights should \nbe reviewed as a minimum. \n \n402. CHECKLISTS \n \nIt is mandatory to use checklists to inspect, start, and ensure aircraft systems are operating \nproperly.  There is no excuse for lack of checklist discipline.  Checklists ensure the \nstandardization of all operating procedures pertaining to the aircraft and provide a logical, safe, \nand precise sequence to follow.   \n \nThe accomplishment of a safe, productive flight begins with a thorough T-6B Preflight Check \nbefore the crew enters the aircraft.  The varied ground checklists ensure the aircraft is properly \nprepared and ready for flight.  Always with safety in mind, remain vigilant and disciplined when \nexecuting the ground checklists.  The majority of your initial checklist training will take place in \nthe simulators prior to your first flight.  By your first Contact flight, you are expected to conduct \nall the checklists as per the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and In-flight Guide (and/or wing \nchecklist guide equivalent). \n \nThe checklists will be conducted in the challenge-action-response format.  This means you report \nthe challenge, accomplish the required action, and state the appropriate response.  As you check \neach item, place your hand on the item to ensure the desired position is selected.  Although never \nconducted from memory, checklists must flow efficiently and precisely. ",

Prior to your first flight, there are several fundamental topics that you, as a \nstudent aviator, must be aware of and understand if you are to obtain maximum benefit from \nyour primary training.  Make your initial appearance, and each succeeding appearance before \nyour instructor, a good one.  Bear in mind that military courtesy and discipline are important  \nfactors in your training and will continue to be so as long as you are a member of the military \nservice. \n \n3. Procedures.  Discuss with the instructor all of the preflight/post-flight items listed under \nContact in the T-6B JPPT Curriculum.  \n \n4. Common Errors. \n \nFailure to know Preflight/Post-flight procedures. \n \n404. PREFLIGHT PLANNING/BRIEFING  \n \nPrior to each flight, you will be scheduled for a brief (discussion) for that flight with your \ninstructor.  The Instructor Pilot (Pilot in Command) is responsible to perform and/or delegate \npreflight planning for the flight (i.e., weight and balance, fuel planning, obtaining weather brief, \nand filing flight plan as necessary).  You will assist as directed, reporting results and noting any \ndiscrepancies.  In later stages of training, you will be tasked with increasing responsibilities with \npreflight planning. \n \nDuring the brief, the instructor will expect you to know the procedures for the maneuvers to be \nflown, along with any \"discuss\" items listed in the T-6B JPPT Curriculum.  With respect to \ncontact flight maneuvers, to “know” is to “memorize” (step by step, though not necessarily \nverbatim) each action of the procedure. \n \nFor emergency procedures, only asterisk items are required to be committed to memory, \nalthough you must have a thorough understanding of the remaining non- asterisk steps and the \nsystems involved.  You cannot prepare for your contact flights solely with this FTI.  You \nmust reference the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual and other publications for emergency \nprocedures (EP), systems, voice communications, and general information.

For example, the FTI, T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual, Aeronautical Information \nManual (AIM) and many ground school texts all contain information germane to your studies.  \nYour instructor may quiz you on each discussion/demonstration and introduction item for that \nflight.  Additionally, he/she may ask you about any maneuver previously introduced or any \nsubject general in nature to the T-6B (systems, limitations, etc.).  The T-6B JPPT Curriculum \nalso has a listing of all emergency procedures to be discussed for each flight.  The T-6B \nNATOPS Flight Manual lists these procedures. \n \n2. Headwork, Procedures, and Basic Airwork \n \na. Headwork - The ability to understand and grasp the meaning of instructions, \ndemonstrations, and explanations; the facility of remembering instructions from day \nto day, the ability to plan a series or sequence of maneuvers or actions, the ability to \nforesee and avoid possible difficulties and the ability to remain alert and spatially \noriented. \n \nHeadwork is the instructor’s evaluation of the student’s situational awareness (SA), \nand his or her ability to effectively manage the aircrew responsibilities.  An example \nof a measure of headwork is whether the student remembers to \"aviate, navigate, \ncommunicate\" in the correct order.  Another measure of headwork is whether the \nstudent is able to effectively communicate his or her SA.  Headwork is purely a \nsubjective item, and the student should never question the instructor’s assessment of \nhis or her headwork. \n \nb. Procedures - The demonstrated knowledge of the sequential steps required to perform \nthe curriculum maneuvers and actions.  Procedures are simply an instructor’s \nevaluation of the SNA’s ability to recall and/or apply the correct procedures to any \nsituation.  This may include emergency procedures, or such things as in-flight checks.  \nIt may also include compliance to course rules or squadron SOP.  Procedures is a \nfairly straightforward item.  Grades other than average are normally given only in \nexceptional cases where students are not able to recite or apply basic procedures \ncorrectly, or when a student demonstrates unusually high competence (strive to be in \nthe latter category). \n \nc. Basic Airwork - Demonstrated mastery of the PCL and flight controls to obtain the \ndesired attitude, heading, airspeed and altitude consistently through a range of \nmaneuvers. \n \n3. Fuel Considerations - The T -6B is usually not fuel limited on most training sorties; \nhowever, regular fuel checks are still required and are an important part of each mission.  Bingo \nfuel and at least one joker fuel is briefed on every mission. \n \na. Joker fuel is set at pre-planned transition points in the sortie.  For example, a Joker \nfuel of 750 lbs might be used to depart the working area to ensure enough fuel to \naccomplish pattern operations.  A mission may require several joker fuels. \n ",

Bingo fuel is the fuel at which recovery should be initiated to arrive at the intended \ndestination with the required fuel.  On most T-6 syllabus training sorties, recovery is \noften initiated prior to reaching bingo fuel due to sortie duration limitations.  Mission \npriorities and flight conditions may change while airborne (area assignment, weather \nconditions, alternate airfield requirements, etc.)  The aircraft commander may adjust \njoker and/bingo fuels during flight to accommodate mission conditions. \n \n405. PREFLIGHT INSPECTION \n \n1. Description.  N/A \n \n2. General.  The pilot who accepts an airplane for flight is in effect the commanding officer \nof that plane and is responsible for the efficient operation and safety of the aircraft, its equipment \nand its crew.  Prior to every flight, a thorough preflight inspection must be performed. \n \nA poor preflight may easily result in an embarrassing, if not dangerous, situation.  Any pilot who \nthinks that there is a possibility that a discrepancy exists which would make the aircraft unsafe \nfor flight should \"down\" the plane, inform maintenance of the trouble, and write a thorough and \ncomprehensive description of the trouble on the Maintenance Action Form (MAF).  Each pilot, \nin signing the aircraft acceptance form (\"A-Sheet\") prior to the flight, acknowledges acceptance \nof the aircraft in a satisfactory, safe-for-flight condition.  He should always keep in mind that \nmistakes are sometimes made even by the most competent mechanics.  The pilot must, therefore, \nmake his inspection accordingly.  Under no circumstances is a pilot required to accept an \nairplane unless it is satisfactory for flight operations in all respects. \n \nRegardless of the number of items you check on a preflight, you will forget something unless \nyou follow a systematic pattern each time.  For this reason, the Preflight procedure published in \nthe T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual shall be used by all pilots. \n \n3. Procedures.  As you approach your aircraft, notice its position and the position of adjacent \naircraft in relation to the yellow parking spots.  An aircraft parked too far off the spots may have \ninsufficient taxi clearance.  Also note the position of fire bottles and other obstructions in relation \nto the path of your aircraft as you leave the chocks.  Although a signalman will direct you out, \nyou have the final responsibility to see that the aircraft clears all obstructions. \n \nEJECTION SEAT SAFETY -“Respect the Seat.”  Think of this motto every time you get in \nand out of a T-6B or any other ejection seat airplane.  Ejection seat and canopy fracturing system \n(CFS) safety is absolutely paramount during ground operations.  If unintentionally or improperly \nfired, results could be fatal.  Take extra care to ensure you and those around you never \ncompromise ejection seat safety. \n \nUpon initially opening the canopy, ensure all safety pins (ejection seat and CFS) are installed, \nper the checklist, and verbally confirm with your instructor.  Never enter or exit the airplane \nwithout the ejection seat safety pins installed.  With the pin(s) removed, always be conscious \nof the ejection handle.

Upon completion of the preflight inspection, your instructor will show you how \nto enter the cockpit, taking care not to step on the canopy rail.  Respect the ejection seat.  The T-\n6B is not a particularly simple aircraft to strap into and it is easy to forget one or more buckles or \nstraps.  Be patient, but precise; there is no fast way to do it.  Reference Figure 4-2. \n \n3. Procedures.  Ensure all of the harness buckles are fastened and G-suit zippers are secure \nbefore entering.  A good method is to start at your feet and work up.  First plug in your G-suit, \nthen fasten your leg garters and Lower Koch fittings.  Attach the main oxygen hose and \nemergency O\n2 hose to your CRU-60/P (before putting on the helmet) and then reach back, grab, \nand fasten the parachute risers to the harness Upper Koch fittings.  You should now be ready \nto don the helmet and lower the visor.  Attach the oxygen mask hose to the CRU-60 and plug \ninto one of the two available ICS cords.  Consult the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual for Notes, \nCautions, and Warnings during pilot hookup. \n \nEach time you fly, your seat position should be the same.  The electric seat adjustment switch is \nlocated on the left console behind the PCL.  When sitting straight in the seat, line up the front \nedge of the instrument glare shield with the upper part of the instrument panel so the top of the \nPFD is just visible.  Adjust rudder pedals so you can get full forward throw of either pedal with \nthe corresponding brake fully depressed without locking your knee. \n \nNOTE \n \nTake extra care to ensure no straps or buckles are entangled with \nany of the side panel switches or components before actuating the \nelectronic seat adjustment to prevent inadvertent (and potentially \nvery costly) damage to the ejection seat and/or cockpit side \nconsoles.

A general rule \nof thumb is to taxi no faster than a person can walk when within the line area and no faster than a \ntrot when outside the line area. \n \n3. Procedures.  Taxiing in the T-6B uses power generated by the propeller, although not \nmore than idle is normally needed.  Speed is controlled with the brakes; power above idle may be \nrequired when initiating the taxi motion, traveling uphill, during sharp turns, etc.  Directional \ncontrol during taxi is accomplished by using the rudder pedals to manipulate the aircraft nose \nwheel steering (NWS) system, or by use of the rudder and/or differential braking.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThis chapter discusses the basic procedures that you will practice at the beginning of your \ncontact training.  These basics will form the foundation of your ability to fly the aircraft and to \nlater perform advanced maneuvers.  You will learn to takeoff, fly straight and level, turn, climb \nand descend.  You will even learn to stall and spin the aircraft.  While some of these maneuvers, \nsuch as Straight-and-Level Flight, may seem simple, they all require strict adherence to the \nprocedures contained in this chapter.  In order to successfully learn to accomplish these \nmaneuvers in the small amount of time that you will be airborne, it is essential that you commit \nthese procedures to memory prior to strapping into the aircraft.  If you do not know the \nprocedures on the ground, you will not be able to perform them in the air.  Some procedures, \nsuch as the spin, require extra care and preparation due to the dynamic and possibly disorienting \nnature of the maneuver. \n \n501.

For \nsafety considerations, complete an operations check at least once every 20-25 minutes in flight, \nwith the first check being accomplished during the initial departure climb. \n \n503. ASSUMING CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT \n \nIt is critical to flight safety that a pilot be at the controls of the aircraft at all times.  A \nmisunderstanding between two pilots as to who is actively controlling the aircraft could become \na causal factor in a mishap.  Therefore, you must be knowledgeable of the procedures involved in \ntransferring controls.  Throughout your flying career, you will fly with many pilots of various \nexperience levels and backgrounds.  To avoid miscommunication, all pilots transfer the controls \nthe same way, regardless of platform. \n \nEither pilot may initiate a change in control of the aircraft.  It shall be accomplished by means of \na positive three-way exchange using the word \"controls.\"  \n \nNOTE \n \nDo not use the words \"it,\" \"aircraft,\" or \"command\" to refer to the \ncontrols.  \n \nFor example, the instructor may initiate by telling you over the ICS, \"I have the controls.\"  You \nwill then acknowledge by saying over the ICS, \"You have the controls.\"  You will then take your \nhands and feet off the controls and your instructor will confirm he has control by saying, \"I have \nthe controls.\" \n \nWhen your instructor wants you to take control, he will say, \"You have the controls,\" whereupon \nyou will take control and acknowledge by saying over the ICS, \"I have the controls.\"  Your \ninstructor will complete the three-way exchange with, \"You have the controls.\"  \n \nStay on the controls and keep flying the aircraft until you are told to do otherwise.  Never be in \ndoubt as to who is doing the flying.  Always fly as if you are flying solo unless you know that the \ninstructor has control.  The important thing is that a \"demand and reply\" series of responses is \nused so that there is no question as to who is flying. \n \n504. COMMUNICATIONS \n \nProper radio communication procedures are extremely important to safety when operating in \ncontrolled airspace or the vicinity of other aircraft.

Takeoff is the movement of the aircraft from its starting point on the runway \nuntil it leaves the ground in controlled flight.  \n \n2. General.  The takeoff requires a smooth transition from ground roll to controlled flight.  \nAlthough a relatively simple maneuver, the takeoff presents numerous potential hazards.  The \ndynamics of high engine thrust, possible directional control problems, the potential for runway \nincursions, high-speed aborts, low-altitude engine failures, to name a few, make the takeoff \nregime of flight unique in its safety challenges.  Thorough and disciplined ground operations \nhelp lead to a safe, uneventful takeoff.   \n \nTakeoffs should always be made as nearly into the wind as practical.  The aircraft’s ground \nspeed in a headwind is slower at liftoff than in a tailwind, thus reducing wear and stress on the \nlanding gear.  Secondly, a shorter distance is required to develop the minimum lift necessary for \ntakeoff and climb.  Aircraft depend on airspeed to fly.  A headwind provides some airspeed \nbefore the aircraft even begins its takeoff ground roll as the wind flows over the wings. \n \nAlthough the takeoff and climb process is one continuous maneuver, it is divided into three \nseparate steps for purposes of explanation:  takeoff roll, rotation, and initial climb (Figure 5-2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5-2  The Takeoff Roll, Rotation, and Initial Climb \n \nThe takeoff roll is the portion of the takeoff procedure during which the aircraft is accelerated \nfrom a standstill to an airspeed providing sufficient lift for it to become airborne. \n \nThe rotation is the act of raising the nose of the aircraft to a set pitch attitude, increasing AOA \nand allowing the aircraft to become airborne in controlled flight. \n \nThe initial climb is the period just after the aircraft has left the runway and is normally \nconsidered complete when the aircraft has reached a safe maneuvering altitude. \n",

Steady the yawing tendency with right rudder as \nthe engine spools up and the aircraft begins rolling down the runway.  Remember, the TAD will \nnot begin making rudder trim adjustments until 80 KIAS and weight off wheels.  As speed \nincreases, more and more pressure will be felt on the flight controls, particularly the elevator and \nrudder.  Since the tail surfaces receive the full effect of the propeller slipstream, they become \neffective first. \n \nTo rotate, apply back elevator pressure at 85 KIAS to gradually raise the nose wheel off the \nrunway and establish the takeoff attitude (8º nose high).  This is referred to as “rotating.”  Allow \nthe aircraft to fly itself off the ground.  Do not force the aircraft into the air with excessive back-\nstick pressure as this will only result in an excessively high pitch attitude, possible stall or tail \nstrike.  Coordinate right rudder as necessary with TAD adjustments during rotation.  Compensate \nfor the left yaw tendency as the aircraft leaves the runway with rudder, not aileron. \n \nAs you move to the initial climb phase of the takeoff, check pitch attitude at approximately 8° \nnose high and begin accelerating.

However, do not stare at the airspeed indicator when making these slight \npitch changes; crosscheck airspeed to confirm the correct pitch picture in relation to the horizon \nis set. \n \nFor takeoff in crosswind conditions, the aircraft will tend to weather-vane into the wind and the \nupwind wing will begin to rise even in light-to-moderate crosswinds.

The procedures for a takeoff with a crosswind are the same as for a no wind \ntakeoff except aileron is held into the wind to keep the wings level.  Aileron deflection is \nnecessary because the upwind wing develops more lift, causing it to fly (begin rising) before the \ndownwind wing.  If the upwind wing rises, skipping may result (Figure 5-4).  Skipping is a series \nof very small bounces caused when the aircraft attempts to fly on one wing and settles back onto \nthe runway.  During these bounces, the aircraft moves sideways and stress on the landing gear is \nincreased.  Anticipate aileron requirement due to the crosswind and either pre-position aileron \ninto the wind or apply aileron into wind as required during takeoff roll.  Use rudder to keep the \naircraft from weather-vaning (for example, crabbing or turning into the wind).  The flight \ncontrols become more effective as airspeed increases, so progressively smaller control inputs are \nrequired to maintain aircraft control. \n \nAs the airplane is taxied into takeoff position, mentally note the winds as called by tower (also \ncheck the windsock and other indicators) so that the presence of a crosswind may be recognized \nand anticipated.  Aileron should be held into the wind as the takeoff roll is started.  As the \nairspeed increases and the ailerons become more effective, adjust the aileron inputs to maintain \nthe wings level. \n \nFirmly rotate the aircraft off the runway when flying speed is reached to avoid side-slipping and \ndamage to the tires.  Once the aircraft has become airborne, initial drift correction is made by \nturning into the wind with a shallow bank, then rolling wings level to maintain runway centerline \n(crabbing). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Straight-and-level flight requires familiarity with flight instruments and visual \ncues.  To fly in level flight, consciously fix reference points on the aircraft in relation to the \nhorizon, and compare or crosscheck this relationship with the flight instruments.  In addition to \noutside references, refer to the PFD to crosscheck the altimeter, and vertical speed indicator. \n \nIn straight-and-level unaccelerated flight at 200 KIAS, the level flight visual pitch picture is \napproximately half-ground/half-sky with the wings equidistant from the horizon, (Figure 5-5).  \nAt higher airspeeds, hold the nose at a lower attitude to maintain level flight; at lower airspeeds, \nhold the nose at a higher attitude.

Good \naircraft control is a continuous succession of minor, almost imperceptible corrections to keep the \naircraft on the desired flight path. \n \nWhen straight and level, trim the aircraft in all three axes.  A trim change is necessary when \ncontinuous control stick or rudder pressure is required to maintain the desired attitude.  Straight-\nand-level flight requires almost no pressure on the controls if the aircraft is properly trimmed and \nthe air is smooth; however, when flying through turbulence, the flight attitude may change \nabruptly. \n \nA properly trimmed aircraft is trimmed for a specific airspeed.  It flies at the trimmed airspeed \nhands-off; that is, with little or no force applied to the control stick or rudders.  Changes to \nairspeed require additional trim input potentially in all three axes, but predominantly in elevator \nand rudder (pitch and yaw) trim.  For example, if the PCL is retarded to slow from 200 to 120 \nKIAS in level flight, the nose of the aircraft drops to seek 200 KIAS.  Back-stick pressure is \nrequired to maintain level flight until nose up trim relieves the back-stick pressure.

Apply trim in the opposite direction to nose or wing \nmovement (for example, if the nose drops apply aft elevator trim, if the aircraft rolls left apply \nright aileron trim). \n \nA common error in straight-and-level flight is to apply force to the control stick inadvertently \ndue to the weight of the pilot’s arm.

VISUAL:  The pilot selects two or more outside visual reference points directly \nahead of the airplane (such as fields, towns, lakes, or distant clouds, to form \npoints along an imaginary line) and keeps the airplane’s nose headed along that \nline.  Roads and section lines on the ground also offer excellent references.  \nStraight flight can be maintained by flying parallel or perpendicular to them.  \n \nStraight flight (constant wings level attitude) may also be accomplished by \nvisually checking the relationship of the airplane’s wingtips with the horizon.  \nBoth wingtips should be equidistant below the horizon, and any necessary \nadjustments should be made with the ailerons, noting the relationship of control \npressure and the airplane’s attitude.  \n \nii.

CORRECTIONS:  Whenever an error in heading is noted, first stop the error \nand stabilize, then correct back to proper heading.  As a rule of thumb, the angle \nof bank used for heading corrections should not exceed the number of degrees \nyou want to turn.  Lead the rollout on heading by the \"one-third rule\" (by the \nnumber of degrees equal to one-third the angle of bank).  This lead in rollout \nwill preclude turning beyond the desired heading.  \n \nContinually observing the wingtips has advantages other than being a positive \ncheck for leveling the wings.  It also helps divert the pilot’s attention from the \nairplane’s nose, prevents a fixed stare, and automatically expands the radius of \nvisual scanning.  In straight-and-level flight, the wingtips can be used for both \nestimating the airplane’s angle of bank, and to a lesser degree, its pitch attitude.  \n \nIn balanced flight, any time the wings are banked, the airplane will turn.  Thus, \nclose attention should be given to the wing position and attitude indicator to \ndetect small indications of bank, and to the heading indicator to note any change \nof direction. \n \n ",

The airplane should be trimmed by first \napplying control pressure to establish the desired attitude, and then adjusting the \ntrim so that the airplane will maintain that attitude without control pressure. \n \nb. Corrections In Straight-And-Level Flight \n \nThere are several methods for correcting a deviation from desired altitude/airspeed \nwhen maintaining level flight.  These consist of a power correction, or a power and \nattitude correction with a continual need for re-trimming.  \n \ni. Off airspeed/on altitude.  If you note that the altitude is being maintained, but \nthe airspeed is slow or fast, a power adjustment is necessary, since power \ncontrols airspeed in level flight.  Remember each torque setting given in this \nmanual is a suggested starting point.  Once the appropriate power setting has \nbeen changed, a change in the pitch may be required to maintain the attitude for \nlevel flight and, as always, re-trim.  \n \nii. Off airspeed/off altitude.  If you have a high airspeed and a loss of altitude or a \nlow airspeed and a gain in altitude, it is the result of not maintaining the proper \nnose attitude.  Stop the loss or gain by resetting the level flight attitude, then \ncorrect by trading the excess altitude or airspeed to return to the desired altitude \nand airspeed.  Re-trim. \n \niii. On airspeed/off altitude.  If you note that you are 100 feet high, yet the \nairspeed is correct, correct to altitude by reducing the power slightly and allow \nthe nose attitude to lower just slightly so the aircraft will descend back to the \ndesired altitude.  Once returned to altitude, reset normal cruise power setting \nand re-trim. \n \n3. Procedures. \n \na. Maintain balanced flight.  Trim. \n \nb.

Basic transitions are used to initiate and/or level off from a climb or descent.  \nThe following are the four basic transitions: climb-to-cruise, cruise-to-climb, cruise-to-descent, \nand descent-to-cruise.  \n \n2. General.  Use the P.A.T. principle to make all transitions.  Because trim is so vital to this \nsection, now would be a good time to review the Trim Requirements discussion in Chapter two. \n \nWhen not in radar contact, clearing turns are mandatory for climbs and descents greater than \n1000 feet.   \n \nNOTE \n \nA method for clearing turns is to use 15º of bank for 30º of turn \neither side of present heading or, if directed, the instructor \nprovided heading.  Don’t focus on flying perfect clearing turns at \nthe expense of actually clearing traffic around you. \n \nYour cockpit references will vary by the type of transition.

Stalls are taught to develop your ability to recognize a complete stall or an \napproaching stall and to recover correctly with a minimum loss of altitude. \n \n2. General.  You will learn to recognize the approaching stall or complete stall through a \ncombination of the senses of sight, sound and feel. \n \na. Vision is useful in detecting a stall condition by noting the attitude of the airplane.  \nThis sense can be fully relied on only when the stall is the result of an unusual \nattitude of the airplane.  However, since the airplane can also be stalled from a normal \nattitude, vision in this instance would be of little help in detecting the approaching \nstall. \n \nb. Hearing is also helpful in sensing a stall condition, since the tone level and intensity \nof sounds incident to flight decrease as the airspeed decreases.  The reduction of the \nnoise made by the air flowing along the canopy as airspeed decreases is also quite \nnoticeable, and when the stall is almost complete, vibration and its incident noises \noften increase greatly. \n \nc. Kinesthesia, or the sensing of change in direction or speed of motion, is probably the \nmost important and the best indicator to the trained and experienced pilot.  If this \nsensitivity is properly developed, it will warn of a decrease in speed or the beginning \nof a settling or \"mushing\" of the airplane. \n \nd. The feeling of control pressures is also very important.  As speed is reduced, the \n\"live\" resistance to pressures on the controls becomes progressively less.  Aircraft \nresponse to control movements also decreases until a complete stall when all controls \ncan be moved with almost no resistance, and with little immediate effect on the \nairplane.  The Stick shaker will normally occur 5-10 knots prior to the stall, with \nairframe buffet occurring almost immediately thereafter.  The stick shaker may \nsometimes mask airframe buffet making it difficult to feel.  In some circumstances, \naircraft buffet may occur before the stick shaker activates. \n \nAccomplish and/or review the THREE Cs before performing stall maneuvers.

Normally, turning \nstalls should be performed in the same direction of the last clearing turn but can be adjusted as \nneeded to remain within the working area boundaries.  Recovery from all stall maneuvers must \nbe accomplished above 6000 feet AGL. \n \nStalls will be preceded by the stick shaker or airframe buffet (whichever occurs first), at which \npoint, recovery will be initiated.  However, during some training maneuvers you will practice \nfull stalls (nose pitches down) before initiating recovery.  This is done, not to foster a complacent \nattitude towards stalls, but to build skill and confidence in the recovery procedures.

Planning a sortie profile that allows maneuvers to be accomplished in an \norder that optimizes time and energy. \n \n2. General.  Energy level is defined by airspeed (kinetic energy) and altitude (potential \nenergy) and is manipulated with power, drag, and G-loading.  Plan maneuvers in an order that \nminimize the requirement for deliberate energy changes, and make use of the inherent energy \ngaining or losing properties of individual maneuvers. \n \na. ALTITUDE AND AIRSPEED EXCHANGE.  Potential energy (altitude) and kinetic \nenergy (airspeed) can be traded.  For example, 1,000 feet of altitude equals \napproximately 50 knots of airspeed with the canopy bow on the horizon and \nmaximum power. \n \nb. OPTIMUM ENERGY LEVEL.  In a typical MOA, optimum energy level for \naerobatic maneuvering is 180 to 200 KIAS at an altitude midway between the top and \nbottom area limits.  Energy is sufficient for any aerobatic maneuver after an airspeed \nor altitude exchange to meet briefed entry parameters. \n \nc. LOSING ENERGY.  Energy may be decreased with low power settings, increased \ndrag (speed brake), or increased AOA (G-loading).  A simple way to lose energy is to \nperform a constant airspeed descent until the desired energy level is reached. \n ",

Every takeoff and landing you make requires you to operate the aircraft at low airspeed.  \nDuring training, students are taught \"flight at minimum controllable airspeed\" so they may learn \nthe effect that airspeed has on aircraft performance and controllability. \n \n3. Procedures. \n \na. CONFIGURATION:  At a safe altitude (complete maneuver above 6,000 feet \nAGL), slow the aircraft below 150 KIAS and configure with the landing gear down. \n \nb.

Left turns require approximately one-half inch of \nright rudder to maintain coordination. \n \nA - Adverse Yaw.  Lack of coordinated rudder during a turn results in weaving or “S-ing” on \nfinal.  Select two points, one directly in front of the aircraft and one approximately 20° to the \nright of the nose.  Without applying rudder, initiate a rapid right turn with 20° bank.  Note the \ninitial tendency of the nose to yaw left.  After approximately 20° of turn, roll out rapidly without \nusing rudder.  The nose continues past the selected roll out point then comes back.  Next, initiate \na right turn, using coordinated rudder.  Notice that the nose immediately tracks in a coordinated \nmanner.  After 20° of turn, roll out using properly coordinated rudder and note that the nose \nstops on the selected rollout point.  \n \nT - Torque and Turns.  The T-6B initially tends to pitch up, yaw, and roll left if positive control \nis not maintained during full power takeoffs and landings.  To demonstrate this, quickly increase \npower to MAX from straight-and-level, coordinated slow-flight and release the controls.  The \nnose tracks up, yaws, and rolls left, and approaches a stall.  Recover from the buffet, prior to \nstall.  Reestablish slow-flight and increase power to MAX again.  This time, hold proper takeoff \npitch and apply coordinated rudder to maintain a proper nose track.  Positive control of the \naircraft ensures safe takeoffs, touch-and-go landings, and go-arounds. \n \nS - Steep Turns.  High angles of bank at slow airspeeds increase stall speed and cause rapid turn \nrates.  Slowly increase bank towards 60° while adding power and back pressure to maintain level \nflight.  Look at a point on the ground and watch the wingtip appear to pivot around the selected \npoint.  The AOA quickly increases, progressing into a stall.  Roll out of the bank to recover from \nthe impending stall. \n \nA - Abrupt Control Movement.  Fixation on the aim point during landing can cause an abrupt \nflare.  Late recognition of the rapidly approaching runway causes the pilot to abruptly raise the \nnose of the aircraft, causing an approach-to-stall condition, a hard landing, or both.  The stick \nshaker activates, but there is no decrease in sink rate.  To demonstrate this, abruptly apply back-\nstick pressure to 20° nose-high to simulate snatching the control stick in the flare.  The AOA \nrapidly increases and the aircraft progresses towards a full stall.  Release backpressure to \nrecover.  To avoid this condition on landing, view the total landing environment and apply \ncontrols in a smooth, positive manner. \n \nF - Flap Retraction.  Flap retraction prior to the recommended airspeeds causes the aircraft to \nlose lift and develop a sink rate.  From straight-and-level coordinated slow-flight, raise the flaps \nfrom LDG to UP without pausing at the TO position.  While retracting the flaps, increase the \npitch attitude to maintain altitude.  Initially airspeed increases (due to reduced drag as flaps begin \nto retract), but as flaps retract towards UP, the AOA increases and a stall results.  Recover from \nthe stall by selecting LDG flaps. \n \nE - Effectiveness of Controls.  Rapid control inputs, especially in the flare, often do not give the \naircraft sufficient time to respond.  Move the ailerons with small, rapid movements.  Notice that \neven with aileron movement, there is little effect on heading or bank during slow-flight.  In slow-\nflight, smooth, positive inputs are required to effectively control the aircraft as there is less \nairflow over the control surfaces at slow airspeeds. ",

At lower pitch attitudes (between 15 and 30°), the aircraft stalls at a \nhigher airspeed and regains flying airspeed faster.  At higher pitch attitudes (between \n30 and 40°), the stall speed is slower and a greater pitch reduction is necessary to \nregain flying airspeed. \n \ng. Use maximum AOA to minimize altitude loss (14-17.9 units AOA).  Avoid a \nsecondary stall (indicated by upward nose track stopping despite increasing back \npressure on the control stick).  A secondary stall is an accelerated stall that occurs \nafter a partial recovery from a preceding stall.  It is caused by attempting to hasten a \nstall recovery when the aircraft has not regained sufficient flying speed.  Recovery is \ncomplete when the aircraft is wings level with a positive rate of climb. \n \nh. Turning Stall.

It \nis caused by an insufficient amount of rudder in relation to the amount of aileron and the angle of \nbank used.  If you roll into a turn without using coordinated rudder and aileron, or if you hold \nrudder against the turn after it has been established, the aircraft will slide sideways towards the \ncenter of the turn.  A slip may also occur in straight-and-level flight if one wing is allowed to \ndrag; that is, flying with one wing low, and holding the nose of the aircraft straight by the use of \nrudder pressure.

Rough entry and recovery control applications.  \n \n521. SPIN \n \n1. Description.  Two primary factors must be present for an aircraft to spin: stalled AOA and \nyaw (rotation about the vertical axis). \n \n2. General.  Spins are taught primarily to increase your confidence in yourself and the \naircraft and improve your orientation in unusual attitudes.  In this respect, spins are an excellent \nintroduction to aerobatics.  Practice them to the left and right.  A spin is very easy to perform and \nrecovery can be just as easily effected.  This maneuver places no excessive loads or stresses on \nthe aircraft when properly executed. \n \nWe practice spins for the same reason we practice stalls.  Stalls and spins are not normal flight \nmaneuvers, but they can occur during flight and only through practice can they be recognized \nrapidly, and recovered from instinctively and reflexively by making the mechanical flight control \ninputs necessary. \n \nSpins are generally performed only for air shows and training, but in WWI spins were used to \ndescend through a cloud layer safely.  With no flight instruments, early aviators who tried to fly \nthrough the clouds could easily get vertigo and enter a spiral with rapidly increasing airspeed that \n(when exceeding V\nne) resulted in destruction of the plane and the aviator.  A solution was to \nenter a spin, descend down through the clouds, and hope you had enough altitude and visibility \nafter breaking out to recover safely.  With technology and instrumentation, this maneuver is no \nlonger needed to descend through a cloud layer. \n \nAn airplane’s design is a compromise between stability and maneuverability.  Modern civilian \ngeneral aviation and transport planes are designed with stability in mind, and although not spin-\nproof, are usually difficult to spin.  Very few modern trainers are certified for spins.  Military \nfighter and attack aircraft, however, are designed for maneuverability and performance.  These \nhigh performance planes have poor stall characteristics and can depart from controlled flight \nreadily and violently during high G and high AOA maneuvering.  A departure usually begins \nwith a stall and can then involve a pitch-up, nose slice, pitch-roll coupling, pitch-yaw coupling or \nsome other type of post-stall gyration, resulting in a spin/out-of-control situation.  To \nsuccessfully recover, the pilot has to immediately assess what is going on and put in the proper \ncontrol inputs to effect recovery.  If the aircraft will not recover, the pilot needs to recognize it in \nample time to eject safely. \n ",

      "text": "CHAPTER FIVE PRIMARY CONTACT \n5-32    FLIGHT PROCEDURES \nFor these reasons, spin training is started early in a Student Naval Aviator’s primary flight \ntraining.  Spins are confidence builders for a student.  They build confidence in his or her own \nability to maintain orientation and reflexively apply proper recovery controls.  They also build \nhis or her confidence in the ability of the airplane to respond to specific flight control inputs and \nregain normal flight.  Even in our relatively stable training plane, an incipient spin can develop \nwith improper or heavy-handed flight control inputs during stall training or aerobatic maneuvers.  \nA snap roll, such as you see in air shows, is simply a spin while flying horizontally (performed \nby abruptly pulling back-stick to stall the wing and kicking rudder in the direction of the desired \nroll).  Instructors Under Training perform fully developed spins and progressive spins to more \nfully investigate the spin characteristics of the T-6B, because they will be doing a lot of \nintentional spins (and perhaps some unintentional ones!) during their tour in the training \ncommand. \n \nNOTE \n \nSpins shall be practiced in the clean configuration.  In the event of \nan unintentional spin with gear and flaps down, they shall be \nretracted immediately to prevent possible damage by exceeding \ntheir speed limitations. \n \na. Spin Entry.  At the stall, positive pilot action is required to effect spin entry by \napplication of pro-spin controls.  At the stall, smoothly apply full rudder in direction \nof desired spin and full back-stick with neutral aileron.  The controls must be held \nfully against the stops or the maneuver may not develop into a spin, but may develop \ninto a spiral with rapidly increasing airspeed. \n \nb. Spin Characteristics.  An erect spin is characterized by roll and yaw in the direction \nof applied rudder, resulting in a barrel roll maneuver to a near level attitude after \ncompleting the first turn.  After completing the initial turn, the nose will pitch to \napproximately 60° below the horizon, with pitch attitude becoming oscillatory.  After \ncompleting approximately 3 turns, the spin will have entered a near steady-state \ncondition.  Spin rotation rates will stabilize to approximately 2 to 3 seconds per turn \nwith altitude loss of 400 to 500 feet per turn.  The angle of attack will be 18+ and \nairspeed will stabilize at 120 to 135 KIAS.  The turn needle will be fully deflected in \nthe direction of the spin.  When performing spins to the left, the pilot may notice \nsome differences in pitch attitude and magnitude of pitch, roll, and yaw oscillations.  \nSpins in either direction may exhibit roll and yaw oscillations after 3 turns with \nneutral ailerons. \n \nAilerons have a pronounced effect on spin characteristics.  With ailerons held in the \ndirection of spin rotation, roll and yaw become noticeably oscillatory.  With ailerons \nheld full opposite to direction of spin rotation, roll and yaw oscillations are damped \nout and the spin appears to reach steady-state in all axes.  You will keep ailerons \nneutral for all your spin training in the T-6B.  \n ",

Stability of the above \nfactors must not be construed to mean that power and controls are necessarily \nstable.  Smoothness comes from recognizing errors early, through a rapid scan, \nand being able to make a small correction before the aircraft deviates outside of \nthe cone.  \n \nThe glideslope (altitude) is controlled primarily with power, and the attitude/ \nairspeed primarily with the stick, but it cannot be overemphasized that there \nmust be a coordinated use of both in any correction.

LANDINGS  \n \n1. Description.  Land smoothly on the main-mounts at the intended point of landing on \nrunway centerline.  \n \n2. General.  Landing is divided into three phases:  1) Landing Transition, 2) Flare and \nTouchdown, and 3) Landing Roll.  Each of these phases serves as a transition from the previous \nphase to the next.  The landing transition serves as the transition from final to the flare; the \ndescent rate on final is drastically reduced as the flight path becomes near horizontal in the flare.  \nThe flare is used to reduce energy in the transition from final to landing airspeed.  The landing \nroll serves as the transition from landing to taxi.  Airspeed is reduced straight-ahead on the \nrunway until at safe taxi speed. \n \nLanding Transition.  Start power reduction and reduce descent rate.  Power reduction reduces \nenergy and helps prevent level-off as aimpoint is shifted.  Descent rate is reduced by shifting the \naim point progressively further down the runway.  As descent and airspeed decrease, power is \nslowly reduced (ultimately to idle in the flare). \n \nFlare and Touchdown.  In the flare, back-stick pressure is slowly increased as power is reduced \nand airspeed decreases.  The aircraft will be in a slight descent or level flight depending on \naltitude, airspeed, power setting, and rate of deceleration.  Use caution to avoid excess back-stick \nwhich could lead to a climb in the flare.  As the nose rises, forward visibility is reduced and \nperipheral vision becomes the key factor in height and drift assessment.  Touchdown is simply an \nend to the flare and should occur as landing speed is attained.  \n \nWhen landing is assured, smoothly retard the PCL to idle and continue back-stick pressure to \nincrease the pitch attitude until the proper landing attitude is reached.  As descent rate and \nairspeed decrease, the aircraft gently settles onto the runway.  Ensure PCL is idle at touchdown. \n \nFlare at a rate proportional to the rate of descent.  For example, higher descent rates require \nfaster application of back-stick to attain normal descent rate prior to touchdown and prevent a \nfirm landing.  Similarly, a lower than normal descent rate requires slower control stick \nmovement to prevent a high flare.  \n \n ",

Throughout the final, flare and touchdown, the aircraft should track in a straight \nline down the runway.  The application of crosswind correction must be continued as necessary \nduring the landing transition and flare to prevent drift.  Since airspeed decreases as the flare \nprogresses, the flight controls gradually become less effective; as a result, the crosswind \ncorrection being held will become inadequate.  When using the wing-low method, it is necessary \nto gradually increase deflection of aileron into the wind as the aircraft decelerates.  As torque \ndecreases, the nose of the aircraft will yaw right.  This yaw must also be accounted for on final. \n \nDo not level the wings; keep the upwind wing down throughout the flare.  Think of flaring over \none wheel.  As the forward momentum decreases, the weight of the aircraft will cause the other \nmain wheel to settle onto the runway.  If the wings are leveled prior to touchdown, the airplane \nwill begin drifting and the touchdown will occur while drifting. \n \nDuring gusty or high wind conditions, extreme caution should be used to make certain that the \naircraft is not drifting or crabbing.  A crab is a condition that occurs when a touchdown is \nexecuted while the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is not aligned with the runway.  Since the \naircraft is actually traveling sideways in relation to the runway, it will impart a tipping moment \nin the direction that the aircraft is traveling.  Touchdown in a crab or drift will also cause the \naircraft to turn away from the intended landing path.  This turn is called a swerve.  Any time a \nswerve develops, centrifugal force will be created commensurate to the speed of the swerve.  It is \ndangerous to land in a crab or drift and could potentially cause the aircraft to depart the runway.  \nIf unable to apply proper crosswind controls before touchdown, or an uncontrollable drift \noccurs during the flare, WAVEOFF! \n \nFull Stop.

The wave-off is a set of standard procedures used to effect the safe \ndiscontinuation of an approach. \n \n2. General.  Occasionally, during your landing practice, you will have to discontinue an \napproach and execute a waveoff.  A waveoff may be initiated by the pilot, or may be directed by \nan external source (RDO, wheels watch, waveoff lights, IP, tower, another aircraft, etc.).  The \nreason for an externally directed waveoff may not be apparent to the pilot, but the waveoff is \nmandatory unless a greater emergency exists.  Do not confuse a waveoff with a stall recovery.  If \na stall indication occurs in the landing pattern, disregard ground track and execute the stall \nrecovery procedures.  After safely climbing away from the ground, reestablish the proper ground \ntrack and execute a waveoff. \n \nAlthough a landing approach may be aborted at any point in the pattern, a waveoff will usually \nbe executed during the approach turn, in the straightaway, or during the landing transition.  Of \ncourse, the sooner a poor landing condition is recognized and the waveoff executed, the safer it \nwill be.  Do not delay the decision to waveoff and do not try to salvage a bad approach.  If at any \ntime your approach does not feel comfortable or you are too close to the aircraft in front of you, \n\"take it around.\"  You should not wait until the last second to make a decision.  Keep in mind \nthat a waveoff is not an emergency procedure unless it is executed too late.  A pilot who \nrecognizes a poor approach situation and executes a proper waveoff well before getting into a \ndangerous situation is demonstrating maturity and good judgment and will never be criticized by \nfellow aviators.

During crosswind landing, \nairflow is greater on the upwind wing because the fuselage reduces airflow over the \ndownwind wing.  This causes a lift differential.  The wind also strikes the fuselage on \nthe upwind side and this causes a rolling moment about the longitudinal axis, which \nmay further assist in raising the upwind wing.  When effects of these two factors are \ngreat enough, one wing may rise even though directional control is maintained. \n \nEffect.  Depending on the amount of crosswind and degree of corrective action, \ndirectional control could be lost.  If no correction is applied, one wing can raise \nenough to cause the other wing to strike the ground. \n \nRecovery.  Use ailerons to keep the wings level.

A complete and \nthorough knowledge of the procedures in this chapter is essential for students who wish to \nprogress to their solo flight.  The memorization and proficient execution of these procedures will \nprove to be one of the greatest challenges to you during Primary Training.  Remember the single \nmost important factor in the execution of any emergency procedure is to first maintain control of \nthe aircraft.  After the aircraft is under control, you must then determine the precise nature of the \nproblem.  It is only at this point that you can execute the applicable emergency procedure and \ndetermine the appropriate landing criteria.  No matter how well you know your procedures, if \nyou lose control of the aircraft or misdiagnose the nature of the malfunction, you will not be \nsuccessful in handling the emergency.  Make sure that you are in control of the aircraft and \nunderstand what the problem is before you attempt to apply a solution. \n \n1. Description.  N/A \n \n2. General.  It is conceivable that during any flight evolution, an engine or system \nmalfunction may occur either while on the ground or in flight.  These malfunctions can range \nfrom system failures to complete power losses.  All emergencies or malfunctions will be handled \nin accordance with T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual procedures, utilizing CRM skills.  When an \nairborne emergency occurs, three basic rules apply.  These rules should be thoroughly \nunderstood by all aircrew: \n \nMaintain aircraft control:  Establishing the aircraft in safe controlled flight should always be \nyour first priority in any emergency, even if it means consciously continuing in straight and level \nflight.  Conversely, if performing aerobatic maneuvers, for example, and the master caution light \nilluminates, accomplish the appropriate VMC recovery and take care of flying the airplane \nbefore delving into the specifics of the caution. \n \nAnalyze the situation and take proper action:  Analyze the indications you have to determine \nthe nature of the emergency.  You should verify what you see in your cockpit with the other \ncrewmember.  Once the problem is diagnosed, apply any applicable boldfaced/asterisk items, \nthen open your Pocket Checklist and with good aircrew coordination, continue with the \nemergency procedure. \n \nLand as soon as conditions permit:  The severity of the problem will dictate the course of \naction to take to safely recover the aircraft.  Review the definitions for \"Land as soon as \npossible\" and \"Land as soon as practical\" in the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual.  Power losses fall \ninto two main categories:  \n \na. Those that occur without warning. \n \nb. Those that present ample warning. ",

This chapter will show the actions to be taken by the pilot \nin the event that the engine fails to operate as designed.  \n \nThe Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP) will be used for both the impending engine failure and \nthe immediate power loss.  A different set of procedures will be required to execute a \nPrecautionary Emergency Landing (PEL) or Power Loss.  However, the ELP profile will be \nflown for both conditions.

      "text": "PRIMARY CONTACT CHAPTER SEVEN \n \nEMERGENCY PROCEDURES    7-3 \n702. EMERGENCY LANDING PATTERN (ELP) \n \n1. Description.  The ELP is a 360° pattern designed to position the aircraft for landing when \npower is not available (Power Loss), or the possibility of a power loss exists or full power is not \navailable (Precautionary Emergency Landing [PEL]).  The ELP is used for both actual/simulated \nPEL and actual/simulated Forced Landings.  If altitude permits, intercept the ELP at 3000 feet \nAGL (2500 feet AGL minimum per the T-6B Flight Manual). \n \n2. General.  If an engine failure or malfunction in flight requires a PEL or a forced landing, a \nthorough understanding of T-6 flight performance, emergency procedures, ELP, and ejection \nsystem capabilities, is critical in the decision to eject or attempt a PEL.  The ELP may be used  \nfor a fire warning in flight, engine failure, uncommanded power change or loss of power, \ncompressor stall, low fuel pressure, chip detector warning, oil system malfunction, \nuncommanded prop feather, bird strike on the propeller, or other unusual engine operation.  If \nthere is any doubt about engine performance, or there is benefit to remaining in the ejection \nenvelope longer, consider recovering using the ELP.  The time available to decide whether to \nrecover via ELP or eject depends on the phase of flight.  Time available can range from a few \nseconds to over 20 minutes for a high-altitude power loss.  ELPs are only flown to suitable \nlanding areas (hard surface runway, taxiway, under run, or overrun) of sufficient length.  \nLanding on an unprepared surface should only be attempted if ejection is not possible. \n \nIn an actual engine failure scenario, the methodology to descend below the minimum controlled \nejection altitude employs a series of critical decisions.  With an actual failed engine, T-6B \naircrews will not descend below 2000 feet AGL unless they are on profile for a field, with the \nrunway in sight and in a position to safely maneuver to land.  Do not delay the decision to eject \nin an unlikely attempt to land on an off duty runway if engine failure occurs while configured in \nthe normal landing pattern. \n \nDistractions resulting from excessive troubleshooting or time-consuming attempts to regain \npower during the execution of the ELP may cause substantial deviation from the standard \npattern, precluding a safe landing at the selected site.  \n \nELP Types.  The depicted profile (Figure 7-2) is used for both a power loss and a PEL.  The \ndifference between a power loss and a PEL is power available.  The power loss is flown with the \nengine inoperative (no power) and the PEL is flown with power available, although engine \nfailure may be imminent or power available may be less than normal.  If flown correctly, the \npower loss and PEL look the same.  However, methods to correct for low energy states differ.  \nFor a power loss, correct for low energy by delaying landing gear or flap extension, intercepting \nthe ELP at some point other than high key (low key, base key, final), and/or adjusting pattern \nground track.  For a PEL, immediately use power to correct for a low energy state as soon as it is \nrecognized and do not delay configuration. \n \nIn a power loss situation, the only way to dissipate excess energy is by early configuration of \ngear/flaps.  In a PEL, extra drag can be induced by use of zero torque or by use of the speed \nbrake.  IPs will simulate a feathered prop by setting power to 4-6% torque. \n ",

      "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT \n7-4    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES \nELP Descent to High Key.  Turn immediately to the nearest suitable field based on aircraft \ncondition, weather, airfield conditions, altitude, and gliding distance available.  In most PEL \nsituations (chip light, low oil pressure, etc.), time is the most critical element.  The longer the \nengine runs, the greater the chance for complete failure.  For this reason, every effort should be \nmade to expedite getting to high key with power.  Don’t turn a PEL into power loss due to slow \nprocedures or excessive troubleshooting! \n \nIn the event of engine malfunction or failure, there may be more than one airfield within glide \ndistance.  Select the most suitable airfield based on the following factors: \n \n1. Distance to airfield. \n \n2. Terrain around airfield. \n \n3. Runway length, width, direction, and condition. \n \n4. Weather. \n \n5. Fire or rescue support. \n \n6. Emergency oxygen and electrical power supply.  Time required for glide from high altitude \nwith engine inoperative may exceed emergency oxygen supply. \n \n7. Threat to the public if aircraft must be abandoned/ejection . \n \nChoosing the Most Suitable Field.  In a PEL situation, time is the most critical element since a \ndegraded engine may stop providing useful power at any time.  Choose the closest hard-surface \nfield with a minimum of a 3000’ runway to set up for the ELP.  If multiple fields meet this \ncriteria, other considerations such as crash crew support or medical assistance may be factored \nin. \n \nDistance Calculations.  A VFR chart, conventional NAVAIDS, and FMS can be used \nwhen judging distance to the selected recovery airfield.  The NRST function on the FMS is \nextremely helpful in providing accurate distance information.  Two primary methods used \nto determine energy state relative to emergency fields are: \n \na. DME Method.  Compare energy state relative to a specific field.  A memory aid for \nthis method is “1/2 DME + KEY.” \n \ni. Determine distance to field (FMS NRST function). \n \nii. Distance divided by 2 = minimum AGL altitude required. \n \niii. Is altitude (AGL) sufficient to reach the field? \n \niv. Add 3,000 feet (high key) or 1,500 feet (low key) to AGL altitude required.

Identify fields within glide distance to high or low key.  Determine most \nsuitable field. \n \nEnergy Management:  Normally the ELP will be entered at high key, but the ELP can be \nintercepted at any point on the ELP profile between high key and final.  Carefully manage \nenergy to arrive at high key on altitude and airspeed.  Attempt to dissipate excess energy \nprior to high key to minimize disorientation and allow the profile to be flown normally.  If \nexcess altitude exists during the glide to high key, lose energy by executing:  360° turns, \nbow ties, S-turns, slips, lower the gear early, or use a combination of these methods.  The \namount of rudder deflection used in a slip should be commensurate with the desired \naltitude loss.  In a PEL situation, expeditiously maneuver towards high key while \nsimultaneously dissipating energy as needed.  All of these methods may be used for both \nPEL and power loss at pilot’s discretion. \n \nNOTE \n \nSlipping with a known engine/oil malfunction could result in \nimpaired windscreen visibility due to oil leakage spraying onto the \nwindshield. \n \na. 360° turns prior to high key (PEL or power loss).

Bow Ties are essentially a continuous set of mild turns in the shape of a \nbow tie flown approximately ½ wing tip distance (WTD) away and on the downwind \nside of the landing area.  With each bow tie, you should attempt to keep the landing \nrunway in sight.  Bow ties are not precise maneuvers and different techniques exist on \nhow to fly them.  Your instructor will provide guidance; however, plan to depart the \nbow ties for high key with sufficient altitude remaining to glide to high key altitude. \n \nc. S-turns.  S-turns are used to affect a milder altitude loss and may be specifically used \nto make controlled corrections while proceeding direct to high key.  Designed to \nincrease the actual track over the ground, S-turns are simply lazy turns back and forth \ndeviating from a straight-line ground track in order to provide more time to descend. \n \nGlide Performance.  A clean glide at 125 KIAS approximates best glide range.  For no-wind \nplanning, a clean aircraft (prop feathered or 4-6% torque set) at 125 KIAS should glide 2 nautical \nmiles for every 1,000 feet of altitude lost, with a VSI of approximately 1350-1500 fpm. \n \na. In an actual PEL situation, check the descent rate after setting 4-6% torque (clean \nconfiguration).  If VSI is greater than 1,500 fpm, increase torque to achieve a 1,350 \nfpm descent.  If power is insufficient to achieve a descent rate less than 1,500 fpm, \nconsider shutting down the engine to improve glide performance. \n \nb. If time permits, use DME or FMS to confirm the actual glide ratio.  Consider winds \nand required turns.  Adjust the plan if actual glide distance varies from expected. \n \nc. If unable to climb or zoom, the ai rcraft travels approximately 0.1 to 0.2 nautical miles \nof horizontal distance for every 10 knots of excess airspeed above 125 KIAS in a \nlevel deceleration.  For example, at 200 KIAS the aircraft glides approximately 1.2 \nNM straight and level before slowing to 125 KIAS. \n \nd. At optimum glide airspeeds, the drag of extended landing gear reduces the glide ratio \n(NM flown to 1000’s of feet of altitude loss) from 2:1 to1.5:1. \n \ne. Ten knots of extra airspeed can be traded for approximately 100 feet of increased \naltitude.  For example, 175 KIAS and 6,000 feet is approximately the same energy \nlevel as 125 KIAS and 6,500 feet.  Once on ELP profile, reduce power to 4-6% \ntorque and maintain altitude as the airspeed bleeds off to 125 KIAS. \n \nAirspeed.  Maintain 125 KIAS minimum clean or 120 KIAS minimum with landing gear \nextended.  To expedite descent to high key in the event of a PEL/PPEL, students may accelerate \nabove 125 KIAS with idle power/speed brakes as required to increase rate of descent. \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Predict energy level (altitude +airspeed) as early as possible at known \nreference points (high key, low key and base key) and anticipate required corrections. \nPosition deviations can occur due to poor planning, imprecise aircraft control, or \nimproper wind analysis.  Trim throughout the ELP to minimize airspeed deviations. \nMake all corrections smooth and expeditious to avoid stall. \n \nb. High Key.  Position the aircraft at high key, 2500-3000 feet AGL, 120 KIAS, gear \ndown, wings level, aligned with the landing direction and approximately one-quarter \nWTD from the runway away from the intended ELP turn direction.  Turn, using angle \nof bank as necessary (~ 15-20° in calm wind), towards the low key position.  \nMaintain 120 KIAS and make appropriate voice call. ",

Approaching low key, crosscheck the runway to evaluate spacing.  Check winds \non PFD and crosscheck with windsock.  Plan final approach accordingly. \n \nii. At low key, level the wings momentarily and check for proper spacing and \naltitude.  If energy is assessed to be adequate to make the runway, lower TO \nflaps (lower flaps no sooner than low key). \n \nNOTE \n \nDelaying TO Flaps because of low energy could potentially result \nin slow final turn airspeed during a power loss.

Do not delay the \ndecision to Eject (actual engine failure) or waveoff (simulated \nengine failure) after determining a safe landing is unlikely. \n \nIf the aircraft is below profile between high key and low key, add \npower to regain altitude (if available).

Adjust the nose attitude in the flare to transition to a normal landing.  \nTouch down on the main gear and then gently lower the nose wheel as in a normal \nlanding.  Apply braking as needed based on runway remaining. \n \ni. PEL.  Reduce power to IDLE when landing is assured.  If runway remaining \nafter touchdown is insufficient to stop, waveoff.  If sufficient power is available \nto obtain low key, attempt a PEL(P).  If power is insufficient or engine failure \noccurs, consider ejection. \n \nii. Power Loss.

Winds can cause ELPs to differ significantly from standard.  An \nuncorrected/unanticipated strong wind component can result in an unsuccessful ELP, even if it \nwas otherwise flown flawlessly. \n \nDetermining Winds.  Surface winds, winds at 1,000 to 3,000 feet, winds at 5,000 feet and \nwinds aloft should be obtained from weather forecasts and serve as a good starting point for \nbuilding situational awareness about actual wind conditions.  The winds at 1,000 to 3,000 \nfeet can vary significantly from surface winds and significantly alter required ELP ground \ntrack.  At tower controlled runways, actual surface winds are known.  Other methods to \ndetermine the winds include: \n \ni. Radio calls to other aircraft, a fixed base operator (FBO) on the field, ASOS , \netc. \n \nii. Without access to actual observations, use winds briefed by weather forecaster \nin the preflight briefing as a starting assumption. \n \niii. If performing an ELP at a non- towered airfield (NTA) without weather \nobservation capability, assume that in the local area, surface winds will be \nsimilar to those at the home field. \n \niv. Observation of surface conditions; smoke, waves on lakes, wind tetrahedron, \nwindsock, etc. \n \nv. Double the surface wind velocity to estimate winds at high key as wind is \ntypically stronger at altitude than at the surface. \n \nvi. Use PFD indications of wind speed and direction. ",

Use the PEL procedure to ensure that a safe landing at a paved field can be \nmade if indications of an impending engine failure should occur.  A PEL will be performed any \ntime engine reliability is questionable or there are indications of impending engine failure. \n \n2. General.  During a practice PEL, the instructor will initiate the procedure by informing the \nstudent of a simulated condition requiring that a PEL be performed.  Indications of an impending \nfailure or power loss could be excessive vibration, smoke or fumes, chip detector annunciator \nlight, fuel or propeller malfunction or any other condition listed in the T-6B NATOPS Flight \nManual requiring that you land as soon as possible. \n \nInitial Actions.  Initial reaction to an engine related malfunction at low altitude should be \nto trade excess airspeed for altitude.  If at high altitude, begin an immediate and expeditious \ndescent towards high key altitude.  If a climb is needed, climb at 140 KIAS (best rate).  Use \nmaximum power of 100% if the emergency is not related to the oil system or strong engine \nvibrations.  If it is oil related, use minimum power as necessary to intercept the ELP and \navoid unnecessary PCL movements.  Once altitude is sufficient to make high key, reduce \npower to 4-6% torque and trim for a 125 KIAS (minimum) descent.  When climbing, do \nnot lose situational awareness or visual contact (if acquired) with the intended landing \nrunway.  When determining altitude required for ELP, be sure to account for winds and \nrequired turns. \n \nNOTE \n \nFor practice PEL training, determine the landing runway at your \nintended landing site before intercepting the ELP profile.  Deliver \na simulated voice report over the ICS to the instructor.  The voice \nreport should include the aircraft Identification, Situation, Position \nand Intentions (ISPI format).

Carefully manage your energy state to arrive at high key on or \nslightly above altitude.  Do not unnecessarily dissipate energy quickly with a failed engine.  Use \nthe extra time to formulate a plan that will maximize the possibility for success. \n \nInitial indications of an engine failure/flameout are:  loss of power and airspeed, rapid decay in \nN\n1, torque, and ITT, and propeller moving toward feather due to loss of oil pressure.  The GEN, \nFUEL PX, and OIL PX warning will illuminate, followed by the OBOGS fail warning.  The \nPMU FAIL and CKPT PX warning may illuminate. \n \nInitial Actions.  Initial reaction to a power loss should be to zoom glide (trade excess airspeed \nfor altitude) or glide towards 125 KIAS in accordance with applicable emergency procedures.  \nZoom capability at 200 KIAS will vary from approximately 600-900 feet.  At higher altitudes, \nthe requirement to zoom or simply decelerate to glide speed is based on distance to the selected \nrecovery field.

INTRODUCTION \n \nFor most students, the First Safe for Solo Checkride will be the most demanding task undertaken \nto date in their aviation career.  While the safe-for-solo check is certainly challenging, successful \ncompletion is a rewarding, confidence-building experience.  \n \n801. THE SOLO FLIGHT \n \n1. Preflight Preparation \n \na. Physical preparation.  Make sure your body is well rested.  The average sleep \nrequirement is eight hours during each 24-hour period.  However, needs will vary \nwith each individual.  Lack of sleep means a lack of awareness.  You should have \nlearned your procedures throughout your training so do not try to \"cram\" the night \nbefore your flight.  Get a good night’s rest.  If you have received your training \nproperly, all that is necessary to prepare for the check flight is a review.  Make sure \nthat your body is well nourished.  If you eat a well-balanced diet regularly, you will \nhave a sufficient energy supply.  Do not depend on a coffee and donut breakfast, or a \ncoke and candy bar lunch.  As always, avoid self-medication, and if you are sick, do \nnot hesitate to see the flight surgeon.  If you are ill, you do not belong in a cockpit. \n \nb. Mental Preparation.  You must know your Standard Operating and Emergency \nProcedures before the flight.  Since you have passed your check flight, you have \ndemonstrated that you can safely operate the aircraft without assistance.  However, \nyou must be even more prepared for the solo, as there will not be an instructor to bail \nyou out of critical situations.  Study those procedures, especially those requiring \nimmediate action.  Prior to the solo, plan your flight in order to make efficient use of \nthe limited time available.  Review the course rules for the area in which you plan to \noperate.  Pay particular attention to location of airfields that may be used in the event \nof an emergency.  You should also ensure that you have the proper flight equipment  \nand checklists in your possession.  Prior to leaving the Flight Duty Officer’s (FDO) \ndesk, you should find out which OLF’s are available for solo operations, their status \nand operating hours.  Ask the FDO if he has any information that may pertain to your \nflight.  And if you have any final questions, do not hesitate to ask. \n \nc. Ground Procedures.  You will be assigned an aircraft for which you are solely \nresponsible after signing the \"A\" sheet.

For the clearing turns, use a \nminimum of 45º AOB and turn for a minimum of 180º.  Throughout the turn thoroughly check \nthe area for  other aircraft. \n \nStart your aerobatic maneuvers from an altitude which will permit a complete maneuver and a \nreturn to straight and level flight at or above 6000 feet.  You must not exceed the maximum \naltitude permitted for your operating area.  The maneuvers performed require approximately \n3000 feet vertically. \n \n901.

      "text": "CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT \n9-2    AEROBATICS \n902. SECTION LINES AND GROUND REFERENCE POINTS \n \nThe maneuver descriptions and procedures of the various aerobatic maneuvers often refer to \nsection lines and ground reference points.  Understanding how to select and use these \ngeographical references will greatly enhance your ability to remain oriented during the various \naerobatic maneuvers. \n \nMuch of the area you will fly over is rural farm land (Whiting) or beachline/waterways (Corpus \nChristi).  The lines which separate one \"section\" of land from another is called a \"section line.\" \nThese lines commonly run north/south or east/west in long, straight lines and are easily identified \nfrom the air.  During the various maneuvers, these section lines are utilized as a reference to \nmaintain directional control.  Since some maneuvers involve a reversal in the direction of flight, \nit becomes necessary to select a line which extends both in front of and behind you.  Highways, \nutility cuts or even beachlines may also be utilized, provided they are linear and of sufficient \nlength. \n \nManeuvers such as the Barrel Roll or Wingover require the use of a ground reference point \nwhich is 90º from your initial heading.  Ensure that the points which you select are prominent \nand easily seen, remembering that you will have to relocate them rapidly as you are passing \nthrough unusual attitudes.  The rate at which you must scan while performing the maneuvers \ndoes not allow the time to search for a hard-to-see reference point.  It is permissible to perform \naerobatics “on top” of a cloud layer without the use of ground references.  Use compass headings \nand altitudes for alignment.  Care must be taken to stay within a designated working area. \n \n903. CLEARING TURNS \n \nDuring aerobatic flight, attitude, altitude and direction of flight change rapidly.  You must \ntherefore exercise extreme caution by ensuring the immediate area is clear of other aircraft and \nthat no danger of midair collision exists.  A clearing turn, as the name implies, allows you to \nclear the area in which you are operating.  Use a minimum of 45º angle of bank and turn for a \nminimum of 180º of heading change.  Two 90º turns in opposite directions will suffice.  The \ndirection of the last clearing turn shall be in the direction in which the maneuver will be \nperformed.  Throughout the turn, check the area thoroughly for other aircraft.  Continue the turn \nuntil you have the desired airspeed and sufficient ground references to maintain orientation \nduring the maneuver.  Remember 180º of turn is a minimum, not an absolute.  One clearing turn \nand Pre-Stalling, Spinning, and Aerobatic Checklist may suffice for a series of aerobatic \nmaneuvers. \n \nIf the number of section lines or ground references is limited, then a teardrop maneuver is an \neffective means of performing the clearing turn while positioning the aircraft for the next \nmaneuver.  This may be performed by turning to place the nose approximately 45º from the \nsection line, timing for 7-10 seconds, and then turning back to the reciprocal of the original \nheading. \n \n \n ",

Failure to execute the maneuver within the cleared airspace. \n \n904. G- INDUCED LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS  \n \nG-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) is a fainting episode caused by gravity-induced \nphysiological stresses on the human body.  The most commonly experienced G-forces are \nencountered by pilots during positive acceleration maneuvers (such as pulling out of a dive or \nturning at high angles of bank).  This type of positive G-force (+Gs) is directed from head to \nfoot, and therefore imparts a feeling of being pressed into the seat.  \n \nThe ultimate effect of these forces on the human body is a tendency for blood to pool both in the \nlower abdomen and the extremities.  This pooling effect dramatically reduces the volume of \nblood available to the eyes and brain, thereby critically reducing the oxygen available to sustain \nvision and conscious brain function.  The typical G-LOC sequence of progression is as follows:  \n \na. Grayout — peripheral vi sion is progressively impaired. \n \nb. Blackout — vision is lost completely.  \n \nc. Loss of consciousness. \n \nOnce G-LOC occurs, it typically lasts from 15-30 seconds.  Once consciousness is regained, the \nindividual usually exhibits a period of uncontrolled muscle spasms followed by disorientation or \na \"dream-like\" state which can last from a few seconds to several minutes.  Some pilots have \ndescribed post G-LOC feelings of detachment, apathy and temporal distortion.  Amnesia of the \nentire episode is a common occurrence.  Impairment of piloting skills may last for as long as 30 \nminutes.  \n \nNavy and Air Force investigators have identified G-LOC as a probable causal factor in numerous \nClass A mishaps.  The Air Force estimates that at least 12% of all Tac-Air pilots have \nexperienced actual G-LOC at least once.  G-loading capability in the T-6B is comparable to most \ntactical jets, and therefore can easily cause G-LOC among the inexperienced or unprepared pilot. \n \n ",

      "text": "CHAPTER NINE PRIMARY CONTACT \n9-4    AEROBATICS \nMost T-6B G-LOC episodes occur during rapid G-loading of 3 to 5 G’s over 2 to 5 second \nintervals.  Pilots can prepare themselves for the physical stress of rapid accelerations and \ntherefore prevent G-LOC by taking certain precautions: \n \n1. Learn and use the proper Anti- G Straining Maneuver (AGSM), more commonly called the \n\"HICK Maneuver.\"  There are two components to the recommended AGSM:  \n \na. The first component is a continuous and maximum contraction (if necessary) of all \nskeletal muscles including the arms, legs, chest, and abdominal muscles.  This tensing \nof the skeletal muscles restricts blood flow in the G-dependent areas of the body and \nthereby assists in the retention of blood in the thoracic region (including the heart) \nand the brain.  \n \nb. The second component of the AGSM involves repeated closing of the respiratory \ntract at 2.5 to 3.0-second intervals.  Its purpose is to counter the downward G force by \nexpanding the lungs and increasing the chest pressure, thereby forcing blood to flow \nfrom the heart to the brain.  \n \nThe respiratory tract is an open breathing system which starts at the nose and mouth and ends \ndeep in the lungs.  It can be completely closed off at several different points, the most effective \nof which is the glottis.  Closing the glottis (which is located behind the \"Adam’s Apple\") yields \nthe highest increase of chest pressure.  The glottis can be closed off by saying the word \"HICK\" \nand catching it about ¾ of the way through the word (\"Hiii-\").  This should be done after a deep \ninspiration, followed by forcefully closing the glottis as you say \"HICK.\"  Bear down for 2.5 to \n3.0 seconds, then rapidly exhale by finishing the word HICK (\"-ka\").  This is immediately \nfollowed by the next deep inhalation, repeating the cycle until the G-loading is discontinued.  \n \nThe exhalation and inhalation phase should last for no more than 0.5 to 1.0 second.  Since the \nblood pressure falls dramatically during this phase, its duration must be kept to a minimum.  \n \nWARNING \n \nDo not hold your respiratory straining too long (more than five \nseconds) since this will prevent the blood from returning to the \nheart properly and may result in loss of consciousness. \n \nAnticipate the onset of high G forces whenever possible.  Skeletal muscles should be tensed prior \nto the onset, coupled with the \"HICK\" respiratory cycle as the G-loading increases.  Initiating the \nAGSM too early can inhibit the body’s natural cardiovascular reflex responses, while beginning \ntoo late creates a deficit situation which may be difficult to overcome.  \n \nNOTE \n \nIf properly performed, the AGSM should provide adequate \nprotection against G-LOC while performing the various aerobatic \nmaneuvers.  If you experience difficulty, or are in doubt as to \nwhether or not you are executing the maneuver correctly, see your \nsquadron flight surgeon or wing Aeromedical Safety Officer. ",

Both individuals must rely on \nthe other not to apply high G forces without first giving prior warning.  Historically poor crew \ncommunication has been a major causal factor in G-LOC episodes.  During high G maneuvers, \nG-suit inflation can inadvertently key the radio transmit switch on the PCL.  Take care to \nposition your leg to prevent this from occurring and blocking communications with your IP. \n \n3. Be prepared physically. \n \na. Avoid flying if ill or extremely fatigued.  \n \nb. Maintain an adequate fluid intake and do not skip meals.  \n \nc. Stay in shape.  The optimum fitness program for increasing G- tolerance is a \ncombination of moderate weight training and cardiovascular aerobic exercise \n(running, walking, swimming, etc.) 2-3 times weekly.  Avoid excessive long distance \nrunning (more than 25 miles per week) or overly intense weight training.

The Wingover will develop your ability to smoothly control the aircraft in \nbalanced flight through constantly changing attitudes and airspeeds.  It is a slow and gentle \nmaneuver when properly executed.  No abrupt control movements are necessary.  The maneuver \nmay be initiated in either direction and is always performed in a series of two.  You should \ntherefore complete the series on the same heading that the first Wingover was initiated.  Flying \nthe maneuver in series will enable you to develop a \"feel\" for the changing control pressures and \nthe rhythm of the maneuver.  Successive Wingovers, when continued without interruption, serve \nas clearing turns for the next series. \n \nWhen your instructor first demonstrates the Wingover, it is of primary importance that you \nacquire a mental picture of the path through which the aircraft is flying.  Notice the appearance \nof the nose and the wings in relation to the ground and the horizon at various points during the \nmaneuver.  Once you are able to visualize this, the Wingover is merely a matter of flying the \naircraft in balanced flight through this pattern.  Since you are learning to fly the aircraft in a \npredetermined pattern, keep your scan primarily outside of the cockpit.  Use your instruments \nonly for an occasional reference to crosscheck your sensory impressions. \n \nThe rate of roll should be constant throughout the maneuver.  The nose should always move at a \nconstant rate in relation to the horizon as it describes arcs, first above and then below the \nhorizon.  Remember that in turns to the right, torque and slipstream effect must be offset with a \ngreater amount of rudder input than in turns to the left.  Proper performance of the maneuver \ndemands smooth coordination of control pressures to maintain balanced flight.  The rate of pitch \nand roll during the Wingover is relatively slow, therefore the resultant increased G-loading is \nrelatively slight.  It should not be necessary to exceed 2.0 Gs at any time during the maneuver. \n \n3. Procedures. \n \na. CONFIGURATION:  Entry airspeed 200-220 KIAS.

Blend aileron, rudder, and elevator \npressures simultaneously to start a gradual climbing turn in the direction of the \nreference point.  The initial bank should be very shallow to prevent excessive turn \nrate.  As the nose is raised, the airspeed decreases, causing the rate of turn to increase.  \nTime the turn and pull-up so the nose reaches the highest pitch attitude \n(approximately 45°) when the aircraft has turned 45° or halfway to the reference \npoint.

The second half of the leaf (nose below horizon) \nshould be symmetric and approximately the same size as the first half (nose above the \nhorizon).  The bank should change at the same rate as during the nose up portion of \nthe leaf.  When the aircraft has turned 135°, the nose should be at its lowest attitude \nand the bank should be 45°.  Continue blending control stick and rudder pressure to \nsimultaneously raise the nose and level the wings.  Monitor the progress of the turn \nby checking the outside reference point (off opposite shoulder from maneuver start).  \nThe aircraft should be wings level at entry airspeed as the nose reaches the horizon, \nhaving completed 180° of turn. \n \nd.

Commence the maneuver by smoothly \nraising the nose while keeping the wings level.  As the nose passes ~20° above the \nhorizon, roll and pull so that the nose travels around in an arcing path towards the \nselected 90º checkpoint.  After 45º of  turn, the angle of bank should be 90º and the \nnose will be at its highest point during the maneuver (approximately 55-60º above the \nhorizon). \n \nc. Continue rolling the aircraft at a constant rate until in a wings level, inverted attitude, \nheading directly at the 90º reference point on the horizon.

Fly the aircraft through the \ninverted position and continue rolling at a constant rate, completing the maneuver on \nthe original heading and altitude.  Maintain a positive \"G\" load throughout the \nmaneuver.  If performed properly, 2.5 Gs should not be exceeded at any time during \nthe maneuver. \n \nd. The nose should appear to make an arcing path about the imaginary point on the \nhorizon 45º from your original heading.  The last half of the arc will, therefore, be the \nsame distance below the horizon that the first half is above the horizon.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThis chapter contains procedures to conduct Angle of Attach (AOA) approaches.  The AOA \napproach is typically used by carrier based airplanes to perform a precision approach to the \ncarrier.  The skills learned by conducting AOA approaches in the T-6B will, however, be used as \na building block for advanced jet training. \n \n1001. ANGLE OF ATTACK APPROACHES \n \n1. Description.  The AOA approach is a descending 180º balanced turn to final followed by a \nnormal flared landing.  During the approach, the optimum AOA is maintained by controlling \nnose/pitch attitude and rate of descent is controlled by power adjustment.  \n \n2. General.  You are introduced to angle of attack approaches for two primary reasons.  One \nis to simply broaden your exposure to different aspects of aviation.  Additionally, AOA \napproaches are commonplace in jet and multi-engine aircraft and are virtually mandatory when \nused with a visual glideslope indicator during carrier landings.  Should you end up flying jets or \nmulti-engine aircraft, your exposure to AOA approaches in the T-6B will be beneficial.  \n \nAOA is displayed on PFD and AOA indexer.  The PFD provides continuous AOA readout.  \nWhen the gear is down, the indexer displays one or two of three illuminated symbols.  \nDepending on which symbols are illuminated, the indexer tells you if you are flying at optimum, \nhigher than optimum, or less than optimum AOA.  Refer to the T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual \nfor further discussion of the AOA system.  \n \nFor a pattern with gear down, flaps LDG, and PCL set for a 3° glidepath, the optimum approach \nspeed (center donut) is approximately 100 KIAS at maximum landing weight.  As landing \nweight decreases, approach AOA (center donut) continues to provide the optimum approach \nspeed and maneuver speed (regardless of bank angle).  Optimum approach airspeed decreases \napproximately 1 knot for every 100 pounds of fuel burned. \n \nThe AOA system in the T-6B is calibrated in units of AOA, not degrees.  An adjustment is \nautomatically made to the readout based on whether the flaps are up, set to TO, or LDG.  \nBecause of this, optimum AOA is 10.5 units, regardless of configuration.  \n \nAs you can see, flying an approach at optimum AOA gives you an adequate safety margin \n(approach airspeed above stall speed), while keeping your approach and landing speed low. \n \n3. Procedures. \n \na. AOA approaches will normally be flown after one or more touch- and-go landings. \nAfter a touch-and-go, climb out at 120 KIAS with the flaps up.  Climb to pattern \naltitude.  ",

At the 180º position, initiate final turn by reducing power to approximately 15-20%. \nLower the nose slightly to maintain 10-11 units, commence the TURN and TALK.  \nYour pattern over the ground should be the same as in previous landings.  You may \nrequire less angle of bank with TO Flap/LDG Flap approaches.  Using the same angle \nof bank as in a normal approach would result in too tight a turn.  \n \nf. During the approach, scan the AOA indexer, the aimpoint and the altimeter.  Adjust \npower and attitude as necessary to maintain the proper rate of descent and 10-11 \nunits.  If the green \"slow\" chevron (\"V\") lights up, your AOA is higher than optimum \nand your airspeed is too slow.  To correct, lower the nose slightly.  The chevron \npoints in the direction the nose needs to go.  Too low of a nose attitude results in \nillumination of the red \"fast\" chevron, indicating less than optimum AOA and \nexcessive airspeed.  In this case, the correct response is to raise the nose.  Again, all \nnose attitude adjustments must be coordinated with power to control altitude/rate of \ndescent.  \n \ng. Rate of descent should be constant.  Vary the angle of bank and power as necessary to \narrive at the proper 90º position (10-11 units AOA, 450 feet AGL or ½ the pattern \naltitude in feet AGL, perpendicular to the runway).  Maintain 10-11 units AOA \nthrough the rest of the turn to final.

      "text": " \nNIGHT CONTACT    11-1 \nCHAPTER ELEVEN \nNIGHT CONTACT \n \n1100. INTRODUCTION \n \nYou are now ready to enter one of the most interesting stages of your flight training - NIGHT \nCONTACT.  There is no reason for you to approach it with any more apprehension than you did \nthe transition from day to night driving in an automobile.  In fact, you will find much in common \nbetween the two experiences.  Just as you did not try to drive at night until you had perfected \nyour skill in handling an automobile in the daylight, you now come to night flying with an \nimproved feel of the airplane and the ability to make your airplane do precisely what you want it \nto do.  One of the greatest tactical advantages of Naval Aviation is our superior night operational \ncapability.  As a fleet Naval Aviator, a great percentage of your flying will be conducted at night. \n \nYour first night flight is not intended to teach you all there is to know about night flying, but to \nfamiliarize you with the fundamentals.  You will come to realize that there are differences in \nnight flying, but that a careful study of these differences will make flying at night as safe as in \nthe daytime.  \n \nGood night flying, like good night driving, requires increased care.  You will have to identify \nobstructions and other aircraft, not by entire outline, but by such small identifying features as a \nfew colored lights.  This is not difficult if you leave the ground well prepared for the conditions \nyou will meet, and if you remain constantly alert.  Once you are in the air, clear of all ground \nobstructions, the only possible obstruction remaining will be other aircraft.  Obviously it is \nessential that you know the location of other aircraft.  \n \n1101. NIGHT FLYING PHYSIOLOGY \n \n1. Night Vision.  You will remember from lectures on flight physiology that the eye uses \ndifferent parts for night vision than for day vision.  Because of the difference in function of the \nrods and cones, technique must be changed in order to spot objects at night:  Do not stare at a \nspot, but scan the vicinity of the sky in which you believe the object to be located.  \n \nThe eyes must be adapted for night vision; the pupils must dilate and the rods must be brought \ninto full use.  It takes approximately 30 minutes for the eyes to become completely adapted, and \nonly 10 seconds for all adaptation to be lost in bright light.  Adaptation may be accomplished by \ntotal darkness or by gradually approaching darkness such as normal daylight to sunset to night.  \n \n2. Vertigo.  Vertigo, in aviation, is a feeling of dizziness and disorientation caused by doubt \nin visual interpretation of your attitude.  This feeling is often experienced at night from lack of a \nwell-defined horizon.  The period immediately after takeoff, leaving a well lighted runway and \nentering complete darkness, brings on this feeling of disorientation.  Trust and use your flight \ninstruments.  \n \n3. Moving and Stationary Lights.  Often you will not be able to see anything of the aircraft \nahead except its tail light or strobe lights.  In such cases, it will be difficult to judge distance, ",

      "text": "CHAPTER ELEVEN PRIMARY CONTACT \n11-2    NIGHT CONTACT \nsince the only criterion for judgment will be changing intensity at changing distance; therefore, \nyou will have to check its movement in relation to known references to ascertain relative \nmovement.  Ordinarily, you can judge distance and relative motion by the distance between two \nlights on the same aircraft.  You will undoubtedly experience some difficulty in discerning \nmoving lights from fixed lights or stars.  This can be further complicated by the autokinetic \neffect, the apparent motion of stationary objects.  Again, this may be overcome by using known \nreferences for comparison.  \n \n1102. PERSONAL PREPARATION \n \nBriefs for all night flights will be given prior to commencing syllabus night operations.  Ensure \nthat you eat a good meal prior to attending the brief.  There are many times when the night’s \nflight operations will be lengthy, so ensure that your body is properly fueled.  \n \nStudents are expected to know Emergency procedures thoroughly prior to the brief and will be \nquizzed on them by the Instructor Pilot.  If you are not absolutely certain about all Night \nprocedures and Emergency procedures, make sure you are certain before you leave the briefing \nroom.  \n \nIn addition to the normal flight equipment required for day flight operations, the following \nequipment is required for all night flights:  \n \n1. Flashlight with clear and red lenses.  \n \n2. Clear visor installed in your helmet (prior to the brief).  \n \n1103. NIGHT GROUND PROCEDURES \n \nThis section provides the basic procedures essential to the safe operation of the airplane on the \nground at night.  These procedures cover night operations both before and after flight. \n \n1104. PREFLIGHT PROCEDURES \n \nThe night preflight will include all items checked on day preflight with the following additions:  \n \n1. Check the operation of all interior lights in both cockpits during the cockpit check.  \n \n2. With the battery on, complete a check of all exterior lights.  Conduct a walk-around of the \naircraft to ensure operation of all exterior lights.  Ensure any discrepancies are corrected prior to \nflight.  \n \n1105. LIGHT SIGNALS \n \nThe student must have a precise knowledge of all light signals to safely conduct night operations.  \nThe T-6B NATOPS Flight Manual contains the required ground handling signals. \n ",

Cockpit lights \nwill dim during start.  When the pilot is ready for the start, he will signal the lineman by rotating \nthe flashlight at the lineman or if ambient light permits, use appropriate hand signals for \nclearance to start.  The lineman will repeat the signal with his wand or appropriate hand signal \nand will man the fire extinguisher for the start.  \n \nNOTE \n \nIn the line area, where adequate light is available, hand signals \nmay be used as in daylight operations.  However, when lighting is \nnot adequate, hand signals must be passed as light signals (see the \nT-6B NATOPS Flight Manual for ground handling signals).  \n \n1107.

Smoothly apply power \nto full forward; following engine spool-up, raise the nose to the takeoff attitude.  Make a normal \ntakeoff by maintaining directional control with rudders and climb out at 120 KIAS.  Make \nheading corrections as necessary to maintain runway centerline as you proceed upwind.  When \nthe proper interval has been established and you are cleared downwind by the tower (at \ncontrolled fields only), you may begin your crosswind turn utilizing a maximum of 45º angle of \nbank  If the preceding aircraft is full-stop, wait until it is 45º behind the wingtip.

      "text": " \nCOMMUNICATIONS    B-1 \nAPPENDIX B \nCOMMUNICATIONS \n \nB100. INTRODUCTION \n \nRadio communications are a critical link in the air traffic control system.  The link can be a \nstrong bond between aircrew and controller, but it can be broken with surprising speed, leading \nto disastrous results.  The most important aspect of aircrew-controller communications is \nunderstanding.  The controller must understand what you want to do before he can properly carry \nout his control duties.  Similarly, you must know exactly what he wants you to do.  Although \nbrevity is important, concise phraseology may not always be adequate.  Use whatever words are \nnecessary to state your message.  It cannot be stressed enough that communication plays a vital \nrole in the flight evolution.  With experience, it should become second nature.  \n \nB101. COMMUNICATION \n \nThere are several things to consider when using aircraft radios: \n \n1. First, pause and listen before you transmit.  If you hear others talking, the keying of your \ntransmitter will be futile.  You will probably jam the frequency, causing them to repeat their call. \nIf you have changed frequencies, allow your receiver time to tune, then listen and make sure the \nfrequency is clear before you begin your transmission.  Also, do not transmit during an exchange \nbetween the controller and another aircraft.  For example, if the controller asks another aircraft a \nquestion, you should wait until the other aircraft has answered before transmitting.  \n \n2. Think before keying your transmitter.  Know what you want to say.  If it is a lengthy \ntransmission such as a flight plan, write it down.  Avoid saying \"and\" prior to each transmission.  \n \n3. After your call, release the button and wait a few seconds before calling again.  The \ncontroller may be jotting down your call sign, looking for your flight plan, transmitting on a \ndifferent frequency, or switching his transmitter to your frequency.  \n \n4. Be alert to the sounds, or lack of sounds, in your receiver.  Check your volume and \nfrequency setting.  Check your equipment to ensure that your microphone is not stuck in the \ntransmit position.  Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods of time \nbecause of unintentional transmitter operation.  This situation is referred to as a \"stuck mike.\" \nAvoid revealing your innermost thoughts during this time.  \n \n5. Be sure that you are within the performance range of station equipment.  UHF radios are \nlimited to \"line-of-sight\" communications.  Remember that as altitude increases, radio range \nincreases.  The approximate range of your radio can be determined by using the range chart \nlocated in the Meteorology section of your Flight Information Handbook (reproduced as  \nFigure 1). \n \nFor example, an aircraft at 5000 feet will have an approximate radio range of 50 nautical miles to \na ground station.

In order to do this, you and controllers will make certain transmissions.  If \nyou know what is to be said ahead of time, responding correctly will be much easier.  Use the \nproper formats and terminology to assist you in making brief and concise transmissions.  Good \nphraseology enhances safety and is the mark of a true professional.  \n \nNOTE \n \nActive ELT signals can interfere with normal communications.  If \nan ELT is broadcasting on Guard, temporarily switch the UHF to \n\"T/R\" (vice \"T/R +G\").

      "text": "PRIMARY CONTACT APPENDIX B \n \nCOMMUNICATIONS    B-3 \n2. Aircraft Call Signs.  Improper or abbreviated call signs can result in a pilot’s executing a \nclearance intended for another aircraft.  As an example, assume that a controller issues an \napproach clearance to an aircraft at the bottom of a holding stack and an aircraft with a similar \ncall sign (at the top of the stack) acknowledges the clearance with the last two or three numbers \nof his call sign.  If the aircraft at the bottom of the stack did not hear the clearance and failed to \nintervene, flight safety would be affected.  This kind of \"human\" error can strike swiftly and is \nextremely difficult to rectify.  You must be certain that aircraft identification is complete and \nclear before taking action on an ATC clearance.  FAA personnel should not abbreviate call signs \nof aircraft having authorized call signs.  FAA may initiate abbreviated call signs of other aircraft \nby using a prefix and the last three digits or letters of the aircraft identification after \ncommunications are established.  Controllers, when aware of similar or identical call signs, will \ntake action to minimize errors by emphasizing certain numbers or letters, by repeating the entire \ncall sign, or by repeating the prefix. \n \nB103. VERBALIZATION \n \n1. Time \n \nThe 24-hour clock system is used in radio-telephone transmissions.  The hour is indicated by the \nfirst two figures and the minutes by the last two figures.  FAA uses Greenwich Mean Time \n(GMT), Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Zulu (\"Z\") for all operations.  \n \nExample: 0000 ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO  \nExample: 0920 ZERO NINER TWO ZERO  \n \nTime may be stated in minutes only (two figures) in radio-telephone communications when no \nmisunderstanding is likely to occur.  When two figures are used, the current hour (within 60 \nminutes) is understood to be the time being referenced.  \n \nExample: \"Mobi le Radio, [Call sign], low -level, entering Victor Romeo One Zero \nTwo Zero at Point Alpha at Four Three, exit Point Foxtrot.\" \n \n\"Four Three\" is understood to mean 43 minutes past the current hour.  If the call was made at \n0935 local time, the aircraft will enter the low-level route at 0943 local.  \n \nCurrent time in use at a station is stated in the nearest quarter minute in order that pilots may use \nthis information for time checks or to set their clocks.  Fractions of quarter minutes less than \neight seconds are stated as the preceding quarter minute; fractions of quarter minutes of eight \nseconds or more are stated as the succeeding quarter minute. \n \nExample: 0929:05 TIME: ZERO NINER TWO NINER STRAIGHT UP 0929:10 \nTIME: ZERO NINER TWO NINER AND ONE QUARTER  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

When advised to \"contact\" a new controlling agency, acknowledge with \"switching\" \nand repeat the specific frequency.  \n \nExample: \"[Call sign], _____ DEPARTURE, contact Houston Center on 322.4.\" \n\"[Call sign], switching 322.4.\"  \n \nIf unable to contact the new agency on the frequency given, return to the transferring \nagency and state, \"No joy.\"  The transferring agency will give you an alternate \nfrequency to reattempt contact.  \n ",

      "text": " \n THE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEF    C-1 \nAPPENDIX C \nTHE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEF \n \nC100. AN OVERVIEW \n \nThe Pre-Flight Briefing Guide is a general purpose format used to discuss the majority of \ncontingencies or emergency considerations that might arise in the course of a normal flight.  Use \nof the Pre-Flight brief is not unique to the T-6B aircraft or to the Naval Air Training Command, \nbut finds application in every aspect of Naval Aviation.  \n \nPreparing the Brief.  The content of the brief includes those details relevant to communications, \nweather, navigation/flight planning and aircraft emergencies that are necessary for the safe and \norderly conduct of a particular flight.  Use the published briefing guide to organize the \ninformation you want to convey and amplify it as required.  \n \nNo briefing is intended to be all-inclusive.  Briefings should be tailored to the mission at hand; \ni.e., a briefing for a Formation hop would involve much additional detail that would not be \nrelevant to a Contact briefing.  Additionally, those missions that intend to take the aircraft into \nIMC weather would include crew coordination specifics that would not be covered in a Contact \nbriefing except as a matter of contingency.  \n \nCrew Coordination.  A fresh buzzword in Naval Aviation recently popularized because of the \nnumber of incidents or mishaps that have occurred without it and which could have easily been \navoided with a little more of it.  A professionally prepared Pre-Flight Brief is step one toward \nmaximum crew coordination and efficient mission completion.  \n \nUse of Standard Operating Procedures.  Reference to Standard Operating Procedures or \npublished regulations is highly encouraged during  briefings to avoid lengthy dissertations, \nprovided that all members of the flight are thoroughly familiar with the procedures.  The Pre-\nFlight Brief itself is founded on the premise of training and operations standardization for \nmaximum combat readiness.  \n \nAny questions?  An often overlooked, but perhaps most important, segment of the Pre-Flight \nbriefing period which should be included in the conclusion of every brief.  Use this period to \nclarify SOP or other details that may be pertinent to the assigned mission.  The members of the \nflight that are being briefed should hold questions until the conclusion of the brief to the greatest \nextent possible.  The enclosed pages are provided as an example or guide in preparing a Pre-\nFlight brief for Contact operations.  It is admittedly wordy and intended for use with local \nStandard Operating Procedures.  \n \nThe T-6B aircraft is inherently reliable.  The odds of any one of these contingencies arising are \nslim, but with a proper Pre-Flight brief, you will be prepared to respond confidently and \ncorrectly should such a situation actually occur.  \n \n \n ",

      "text": "APPENDIX C PRIMARY CONTACT \nC-2    THE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEF \nC101. THE BRIEFING \n \nThe brief should serve several functions.  First, the brief should serve to inform all crewmembers \nabout elements critical to safe mission completion.  A briefing guide shall be used to prompt the \nbriefer, but all items in the briefing guide will not apply to every mission.  Items that do not \napply may be passed over without mention.  Those items which will be handled routinely in \naccordance with a published instruction may be briefed as such.  Of particular importance to the \nStudent Naval Aviator in this portion of the brief is the sequence of events or route of flight.  \nLeave nothing to unspoken assumption; the instructor pilot expects his or her students to ask \nquestions.  \n \nJust as important to dissemination of information in briefing is the delineation of cockpit \nresponsibilities.  This function is the cornerstone of crew coordination.  Put some serious thought \ninto how tasks will actually be performed in normal and emergency conditions, then brief them \nas such.  All crewmembers are responsible for ensuring that the flight conforms to existing \nlimitations.  Where the pilot in command does not specify stricter limits, existing SOP or the  \nT-6B NATOPS Flight Manual always applies.  \n \nAnother function of the brief is for the pilot in command to determine whether or not his crew is \nready to fly.  In the training command, the instructor pilot will evaluate a student’s motivation \nand degree of readiness by checking the student’s knowledge against standards established in the \nT-6B JPPT Curriculum.  \n \nFor all flights, each student being graded shall check existing and forecast weather, and furnish \nthe instructor with a grading sheet.  The student shall bring a Master Curriculum Guide (MCG), \nPocket Checklist, and all required charts and pubs to the brief.  The flight shall be conducted as \nbriefed.  When circumstances require a change in plans, the pilot in command is responsible for \nupdating the brief.  When any crewmember is unclear with regard to any changes in plans, it is \nhis or her responsibility to resolve any questions.  \n ",
